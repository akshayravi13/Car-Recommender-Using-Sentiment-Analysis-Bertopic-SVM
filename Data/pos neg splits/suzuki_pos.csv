Put on a coat of turtle wax ice and it looks great. Only problem was pass seat airbag light but was resolved in one visit. 12k out the door cash and we are really happy with it! Lots of room for a small car and with some things like new wheels and tires maybe springs it will handle even better. Also try a k&n airfilter it will bump up the hp and gas mileage!

 on 08/27/17 11:24 AM (PDT),Alyssa ,2007 Suzuki Forenza Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),What was I thinking?!," Before buying a car I decided a 4 door sedan was the best option for me. I did not however know where to start. If interested in buying this car, don't be. There is a lot of matience that comes with the type of car. I did purchase my car from a pay here buy here and I know it's not the greatest place to get one but as someone who is just starting to get started on establishing some credit it's hard to find somewhere to get a car. I saw this car I particular and I was very intrigued by it. It was my favorite color and it had great gas mileage and it would be a reliable car I was told. However the opposite is true. I have spent so much money into making this car driveable. So far I have had to replace normal wear and tear (tires and windshield wippers, etc.) I knew I would have to eventually. I did not think that I would have to spend so much though. I have since getting the car almost a year ago, replaced the engine, fuel pump, radiator and spark plugs. All in the matter of about 8 months. I had the car sitting from the first week I got it for 4 months because I could not drive it because of the fact that the engine pistons had bent inside of the engine. So in all I have only had the car for about 3 months out of the year because then it sat again because the radiator busted so I had to repair that.Edit.... I now do not have the car and sold it to a shop to take it apart and use it for scraps. At the end, my ignition started to go as well. I would drive it in the neighborhood and all of a sudden the car would slam on the brakes by itself and then start going again without me pressing the gas or break. If I did try to press either, the car wouldnât do anything. It became a danger to not only me but the cars around me as well as my family. I had no other option but to sell it to a shop because of the danger it could cause to many more people. It has been a year since I sold the car and I am so happy that I did because now I know that the buy here pay here place that I got it from did not know anything about the car and that they only wanted money. Please please please, if you are searching for a car for your teenager, that you look at official shops and make sure that the car is thoroughly checked out.

I did not however know where to start. If interested in buying this car, don't be. There is a lot of matience that comes with the type of car. I did purchase my car from a pay here buy here and I know it's not the greatest place to get one but as someone who is just starting to get started on establishing some credit it's hard to find somewhere to get a car. I saw this car I particular and I was very intrigued by it. It was my favorite color and it had great gas mileage and it would be a reliable car I was told. However the opposite is true. I have spent so much money into making this car driveable. So far I have had to replace normal wear and tear (tires and windshield wippers, etc.) I knew I would have to eventually. I did not think that I would have to spend so much though. I have since getting the car almost a year ago, replaced the engine, fuel pump, radiator and spark plugs. All in the matter of about 8 months. I had the car sitting from the first week I got it for 4 months because I could not drive it because of the fact that the engine pistons had bent inside of the engine. So in all I have only had the car for about 3 months out of the year because then it sat again because the radiator busted so I had to repair that.Edit.... I now do not have the car and sold it to a shop to take it apart and use it for scraps. At the end, my ignition started to go as well. I would drive it in the neighborhood and all of a sudden the car would slam on the brakes by itself and then start going again without me pressing the gas or break. If I did try to press either, the car wouldnât do anything. It became a danger to not only me but the cars around me as well as my family. I had no other option but to sell it to a shop because of the danger it could cause to many more people. It has been a year since I sold the car and I am so happy that I did because now I know that the buy here pay here place that I got it from did not know anything about the car and that they only wanted money. Please please please, if you are searching for a car for your teenager, that you look at official shops and make sure that the car is thoroughly checked out.

I REALLY didn't want it to be totaled & was so disappointed when I got the news from the insurance company. I really wish I still had my car. The Grand Vitara was the most reliable car I've ever owned, along with a Honda Civic I owned in the 90s. And I've owned lots of different cars- Oldsmobile, Mazda, Mercedes, BMW, etc....I never had any problems with the Vitara whatsoever. It had over 87,000 miles on it when I lost it, and I had never had to take it in for anything other than oil changes, battery replacement, and a recall on the catalytic converter. SUCH a reliable car! I took it to the mountains, it did great. Took it to the beach, it did great. Drove it for 12 hour drives out of town on more than one occasion, did great. Handled well on clear roads, snow & rain, smooth ride, super quiet, really comfortable, good speakers, good gas mileage. I could drive 5 hours straight on a full tank. The ONLY complaint I really can think of, is that since I'm pretty short, the headrest curved a bit towards the back of my head, so when driving long distances, my neck would start to hurt just a bit after a few hours- but that's literally because I'm short and due to where my head was in relation to the back of the seat. In the end, my head actually hit that part of the seat in my auto accident & caused me a nice bump. If you're around 5'3"" like me with a short torso, I would still highly recommend the car but just be aware of that. The cargo area was quite spacious- I have moved plenty of boxes & a desk at once with the back seats down, no problem. Suzuki did a great job with this car. It's really a beast & can handle lots of situations well. I'm so nervous to try any other car now!",5.0,"I LOVED MY GRAND VITARA!!

I'm not kidding when I say it was the best car I've ever owned. It felt solid and was dependable. Very capable in snow. It helped save my parrot's life - I had to take her into the doctor's office during record snowfall and we made it. No major repairs. Just regular maintenance, be sure to keep fluids up especially the transmission transfer case and differential. The V6 engine is pretty fuel efficient if you keep the speed down to 55 or 60 mph. 23 mpg combined with mostly highway driving. I loved the design of the dash - major lights were white and blue, secondary controls in red. Very beautiful. The interior materials - dash and instrument panels where the radio is - are a step up from previous Suzuki's I've owned. My only complaint is with the CD Radio for the 2006 year. Plan on replacing it - the CD seems to break down quickly. If you replace it with a 2007 or newer CD player it will last. Great trivia - The Suzuki V6 engine is also used as an aircraft engine - for a 3/4 scale P-51 Mustang WWII reissue. Suzuki also helped design the Saturn Vue.

She is garage kept and has her regular maintenance. I've never had any major issues. I believe there were 2 or 3 recalls which the dealership fixed right up with no problems. One of the dash lights where there gas gauge is located died about 2 years after I got her but it wasn't worth the price to pay to have it fixed, I can see the gauge with no problem so that never became a real problem.  She is super fun to drive, so much so my husband likes to drive her on the weekends. She's zippy, easy to handle, small enough to fit just about anywhere but yet it's roomy enough to fit a bike in the back with the back seats down. The AWD is great, we live in Central Florida and get lots of rain and I've always felt safe. My teenage daughters learned to drive in my car and have always felt comfortable. If I could I would buy a newer model but for now I will stick with my lil baby. When I see her in the parking lot I still think she looks so cute, sporty and fun. Mine is pearl white and has tinted windows which makes it look really sharp. When I see others without the tint I think it looks unfinished for some reason.Now the cons on her are all cosmetic. I still have the factory stereo which sounds great but there isn't a USB or Aux input for my iphone so I had to purchase a compatible plug which wasn't a problem. I'm sure I'll probably put a bluetooth stereo in soon. The other con is no front arm rest, so I purchased one online that sits in the middle holder and has a compartment. Also it seats 5 but the back seat isn't really comfortable for 3 adults. I got lucky and had 3 children but they did always complain it was uncomfortable and the headrests had to be raised up which was bad from me as the driver because I had a hard time seeing out the back window.I love this car and will love her til she gives out on me which hopefully won't be for a long time.**UPDATE: 6-13-17 I still own my car but my 18 year old daughter drives it about 90% of the time. She loves it and has decided that instead of her purchasing a new vehicle she would like to buy mine and for me get a new car. Only reason I would give it up is because I feel it's a safe, reliable, well maintained car for her and she's very comfortable in it to drive to college.

And it has a six, count 'em SIX speed manual transmission!  I was looking for a car with a manual to use as a commuter, and was able to buy this 2010 (in 2016) with 71K on it for $2700!  I was pretty happy, let me tell you.  It has been a blast to drive, even though in central Illinois the roads are pretty straight and flat.  The clutch take-up is p-e-r-f-e-c-t and the shifter is smooth and creamy - the nicest and easiest manual I think I've ever driven.  I think the Italian design is attractive/cute and this thing zips in and out of traffic lanes and parking spots with ease.  I have yet to reach it's handling limits, but will tell you they're very high.  This is like a reliable version of the Mini (which has pathetic reliability and costs much, much more).  The only things with which I take issue on the car are the sun visors that don't tilt forward enough and block my view (and let sunlight in on the sides) and poor AM radio reception.  That, and parts being a little tougher to find since Suzuki (cars) left the country.  Still plenty of parts available if you search hard enough, though - and oil filters, air filters, plugs etc are pretty standard sizes so super easy to find.  Oh, and insurance is a bit high - higher than my wife's '14 Honda CR-V, for some reason.  MPG has been good for me - about 31 mixed 60/40 hwy/city.  Plenty of front seat room - I'm 6' tall and 230 lbs and don't feel the least bit crowded - plenty of fore/aft and up/down adjustment.  Rear seat room does look tight on legroom, though - so it's probably best for short trips for adults or for mini-me's.  After doing my research, the only problem areas on these seem to be an errant airbag light (covered under recall), and the A/C compressor clutch.

Read various Suzuki forums if you don't believe me, it is notorious for this issue and Suzuki never did anything to resolve it. Expect to spend $150-$300 depending on the morals of the repair shop to have the sensor replaced, every 2-3 years. So, in 2008 my radiator sprung a leak, then the radiator hoses, then the pulleys started failing. First it was the accessory pulley, then the crank shaft pulley. Then the AC compressor and condenser both failed in the same month. Then the front brake calipers failed followed by the rear drum brake shoes. Then the tail pipe fell off, the manifold developed a leak and then the exhaust mounts failed. Thermostat failed, engine coil failed, and the rear brake light fell down. Pins that hold the bumpers on started disappearing, the handle of the oil dip stick snapped off, the interior driver door handle broke off, the exterior driver door handle snapped, the hood brace clip broke and the hinge for the fuel door has disintegrated. Now, I am not saying this vehicle isn't reliable, I put 220,000 miles on mine, but it has cost over $5,000 in repairs to keep it running. Once it hit that 6 year mark there was something each year that failed on the vehicle requiring repair. Suzuki left the US market, as a result, I would not recommend buying any Suzuki vehicle. You will run into difficulty finding parts to keep it running and the O2 sensor can and will fail on you frequently.

The car has been very reliable with some problems here and there, but its mostly due to age. The transmission has never given me any problems. Its amazing in the snow; after 10 years of ownership, this year was the first year it got stuck in the snow because the street wasn't plowed and the vehicle got high centered. The snow was up halfway to my thighs (I'm 6'2). Recommended transmission fluid change for the A/T is at 100,000 which I reached 2 years ago. No problems with the transmission even though it had the original transmission fluid for 16 years. This car has a rust issue, but it has seen very severe winters over the years being in Boston when my cousin owned it and now here in NY with me. The rust has gotten so bad that the part where the chassis meets the bumper is has almost completely rusted away on one side. The most expensive repair has been the 4WD auto locking hub in the front left wheel that slipped out of place which was due to my dad accelerating too hard when he engaged 4WD; that part cost around $450-$500(labor inc). The other two expensive repairs was the EGR valve and alternator that each cost between $200-$250(labor inc). The car has been very reliable over the years. Being in NY it doesn't feel as solid as it once did because the potholes in my area are horrendous, at one point even loosened the plates in the muffler which caused it to rattle. We average about 12 mpg city because of the heavy traffic in our area and about 25mpg on long interstate stretched. The car has been great, but it is now 19 years old and its time for a new one.",4.0,"Great Value I bought this car from my cousin in 2006 with 69,700 miles.

 on 07/14/16 07:19 AM (PDT),David ,2006 Suzuki XL-7 SUV Premium 4dr SUV 4WD (2.7L 6cyl 5A),Best $27K I've spent," Bought our XL7 Premium 4x4 new in May of 2006 and still own it.  It now has 110k on the odometer and I'm here to tell you that it's the best car I've ever owned in regards to being problem free and reliable.  This beast has never failed me.

I have gone from 91k miles up to 215k and it's still running like a champ despite my lack of consistent maintenance. I've gone through all the normal stuff like tires, breaks, batteries, windshield wipers, headlights, oil changes and have very few complaints. 1 - not quite enough space for a rear-facing infant carrier. I have to pull up the passenger front seat to the point where only a small adult would be able to sit comfortably. I'm 5'7"" and can't sit as a passenger up front with a rear facing infant seat in the vehicle. 2 - I've got a bit of an oil leak and lose about 2 qts a month. 3 - my fuel economy has dropped to an average of 13-15 mpg regardless of city or highway miles. BUT THAT'S IT. Everything else about this vehicle has been amazing. It handles more like a car but after putting a tow hitch on myself (ridiculously super easy by the way to do so) I've been able to tow trailers and even drift boats without any issues. My XL7 handles well on both sand and even pebbly river banks (with a trailer even). It handles well in the snow and even ice, though I would suggest adding a few sandbags for extra weight when there is ice on the road for more than a day. It's a great height for transporting both kids and dogs as both can easily climb in and out on their own. There are child LATCHes which make it easy for child car-seats, booster-seats, and infant carriers to be snapped in and secured quickly.

I have to pull up the passenger front seat to the point where only a small adult would be able to sit comfortably. I'm 5'7"" and can't sit as a passenger up front with a rear facing infant seat in the vehicle. 2 - I've got a bit of an oil leak and lose about 2 qts a month. 3 - my fuel economy has dropped to an average of 13-15 mpg regardless of city or highway miles.

 on 11/08/11 17:13 PM (PST),edbearnz ,2011 Suzuki Kizashi Sedan Sport SLS 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Is this the best value car you can buy?," We recently purchased our second new car, (weÂve had many second hand cars over the years), having had to sell our 12 year-old Nissan Pulsar SLX due to me breaking my back in a car accident last year. The seating position of the Pulsar was no longer tenable for me and I had to get a vehicle with a higher, more ergonomically correct seat. We bought the Pulsar new in 1999 and it had been a pleasure to own and was well specced for the time with ABS, driver's air-bag, four-wheel disc brakes, air-conditioning, factory alloys and the engine was chain-drive DOHC with VVT. It was the cheapest car to own we'd ever had and I was sad to see it go. After briefly considering second hand cars, I was conscious that had I been driving a vehicle with traction control, I would not have crashed, spinning out on oil, so when looking at later models with this feature I decided to go with another new car. My requirements centered around my physical needs, but I wanted several other things. The car had to have the latest in technology as I felt it was a waste of time buying older technology that was already outdated and due to be replaced. I wanted fuel economy that was at least as good as the 1600cc Nissan Pulsar auto we'd just sold and the car had to be value for money.  We wanted an automatic so manual cars were not considered. This ruled out the otherwise excellent Ford Fiesta Econetic as it was only available in manual form. So too, the Toyota Rav4 diesel, the petrol being too thirsty. It became apparent early on that the small cars of today are excellent vehicles and all were superior in power and economy, ride and handling and of course features by comparison to our 12 year old Pulsar, with the Honda City the best over all, but the Swift being cheaper equalled the ride and comfort factor emphasising to me just why it is NZ's best selling small car. Also in the early running was the Honda Insight hybrid, which I liked but the passenger seat was uncomfortable and my wife didn't like the rear view through the mirror, the split window was disconcerting to her. So despite the lowest running costs, even over the Fiesta once RUC's, were counted, (Road User Charges - New Zealand has a separate charge for mileage on diesel vehicles on a $ per Kilometer basis, and Diesel fuel is not taxed at the pump. Depending on size and type of vehicle you pay a particular charge per Kilometer), the Insight dropped off the list. I looked at SUV's but despite the great performance and economy of the new generation diesel's, with the Hyundai ix35 being the best of them, I didn't need the size and expense. On a $ per km figure including RUC's they were going to cost the same as the medium sized petrol cars to run. So that left me to look at the medium car market as an alternative to buying a small car. The Suzuki SX4i AWD is unique and a great wee SUV with comfort, features and power, but let itself down on wind and engine noise. A shame because otherwise I'd have bought it! It was amazing to realise that the new cars with 2.4lt engines could equal the Pulsar for fuel economy while being a lot bigger and a lot more powerful! I compared the Ford Mondeo Titanium Hatch diesel, the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord Euro, Hyundai i45, VW Passat and the Suzuki Kizashi Ltd. and Sport. The Camry was the first to go as it was dearer and less economical and while the ride and seating were comfortable it was very plain-Jane.

My back is happy and we look forward to many years of service from what has to be the best mid-sized car on the road today! ",4.75,"Is this the best value car you can buy? We recently purchased our second new car, (weÂve had many second hand cars over the years), having had to sell our 12 year-old Nissan Pulsar SLX due to me breaking my back in a car accident last year. The seating position of the Pulsar was no longer tenable for me and I had to get a vehicle with a higher, more ergonomically correct seat. We bought the Pulsar new in 1999 and it had been a pleasure to own and was well specced for the time with ABS, driver's air-bag, four-wheel disc brakes, air-conditioning, factory alloys and the engine was chain-drive DOHC with VVT. It was the cheapest car to own we'd ever had and I was sad to see it go. After briefly considering second hand cars, I was conscious that had I been driving a vehicle with traction control, I would not have crashed, spinning out on oil, so when looking at later models with this feature I decided to go with another new car. My requirements centered around my physical needs, but I wanted several other things. The car had to have the latest in technology as I felt it was a waste of time buying older technology that was already outdated and due to be replaced. I wanted fuel economy that was at least as good as the 1600cc Nissan Pulsar auto we'd just sold and the car had to be value for money.  We wanted an automatic so manual cars were not considered. This ruled out the otherwise excellent Ford Fiesta Econetic as it was only available in manual form. So too, the Toyota Rav4 diesel, the petrol being too thirsty. It became apparent early on that the small cars of today are excellent vehicles and all were superior in power and economy, ride and handling and of course features by comparison to our 12 year old Pulsar, with the Honda City the best over all, but the Swift being cheaper equalled the ride and comfort factor emphasising to me just why it is NZ's best selling small car. Also in the early running was the Honda Insight hybrid, which I liked but the passenger seat was uncomfortable and my wife didn't like the rear view through the mirror, the split window was disconcerting to her. So despite the lowest running costs, even over the Fiesta once RUC's, were counted, (Road User Charges - New Zealand has a separate charge for mileage on diesel vehicles on a $ per Kilometer basis, and Diesel fuel is not taxed at the pump. Depending on size and type of vehicle you pay a particular charge per Kilometer), the Insight dropped off the list. I looked at SUV's but despite the great performance and economy of the new generation diesel's, with the Hyundai ix35 being the best of them, I didn't need the size and expense. On a $ per km figure including RUC's they were going to cost the same as the medium sized petrol cars to run. So that left me to look at the medium car market as an alternative to buying a small car. The Suzuki SX4i AWD is unique and a great wee SUV with comfort, features and power, but let itself down on wind and engine noise. A shame because otherwise I'd have bought it! It was amazing to realise that the new cars with 2.4lt engines could equal the Pulsar for fuel economy while being a lot bigger and a lot more powerful! I compared the Ford Mondeo Titanium Hatch diesel, the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord Euro, Hyundai i45, VW Passat and the Suzuki Kizashi Ltd. and Sport. The Camry was the first to go as it was dearer and less economical and while the ride and seating were comfortable it was very plain-Jane. It was also a run-out model, due to be replaced with an all new one. The VW was too dear as was the Honda Accord. The Hyundai was my early favourite for technology, style, economy, features and seemed good value. It was perfect in driving position and nearly took the prize. Until I tried the Kizashi...
