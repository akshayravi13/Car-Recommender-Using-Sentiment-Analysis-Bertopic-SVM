End 6/14 (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),"29 months in, very pleased but wish we got the V60"," S60 R design Platinum.   Zero issues over the past 2 years plus.  Mileage is 22.5mpg short trips mostly with a couple of highway trips a year, 28 mpg on expressway at 70mph,   Gas tank is maybe 17 gal so range is only about 450 miles w/o pushing your luck.  Acceleration is as much as a sane person would every need.  Effortless and tons of torque is around way down low in the rev band.   Smooth engine that growls if you punch it but is otherwise quiet.   Throttle uptake is very touchy, unfortunately, taking a light foot to avoid lurching forward. Steering is precise but could use more road feel, though almost no cars have that any more.  AWD and 350 lb ft of torque are a great pairing, as you can floor it from a stop and turn into traffic with no fear of fishtailing, and it gives great confidence.  Minimal body roll, changed to almost none with the addition of an aftermarket tuner rear anti-sway bar.  I have since removed the aftermarket bar and sold it, finding it unnecessary.  Handling is confidence inspiring.  Reviews that talk of small differences between this and BMW are living in a fantasy land where people oversteer their cars around curves on public roads.   The G forces you feel in turns are more than enough to have you slow down before the grip of the tires is lost to understeer.   This is a sport sedan, not a sports car.  Braking is not as quick as the XC60,  with the pedal having more play before it really bites.  Once you're used to the difference it's fine.  Ride quality is firm but never harsh, noise levels are good on good roads, higher on bad ones.  But again, never uncomfortable.   Better ride and noise levels than our E90 BMW 3 series with 18"" wheels, I'd say.   We have the 19"" on this R design.   But this car will not please those looking for luxury quiet first and foremost.   On concrete expressways you get tire hum.Trunk is pretty small,  rear seat room isn't an issue for us but it isn't big.  But we added 2 more dogs for a total of 4 so we wish we'd waited to find a V60 R design for the extra space in back. Insurance costs are low ($850/yr full coverage $500K liability) but we are middle aged.  The upgraded Platinum level Stereo is surprisingly good for having no dedicated sub-woofer.  The Nav system is not very good at all.   Just use your phone or a Garmin.  It will send you on crazy turns on small roads and the interface is cumbersome.   The dash is great looking and the big digital speed readout really makes a HUD superfluous.   Climate control works fine, the interface for the entertainment system is not touch but works fine once you learn that the button on the wheel controls most things. (along with one on the panel your passenger can operate)Comfort is great on long trips, the seats are the best I've had in a sedan.  They soften with time, btw.   Visibility is not great in blind spots.  I thought the BLIS was a waste of money, but it really comes in handy in heavy expressway traffic where long looks at your blind spot are not always safe.   I still check, but do so knowing my BLIS will back me up and alert if I try to signal a turn with someone there.   It also has the ability to ""See""   cars overtaking you and prevent you from getting in front of them if there isn't time for them to react.   It works very well and unobtrusively with a light most of the time, alerting only if you attempt to change lanes.  The interior has held up well and I expect it to continue to.  Material quality really is superior, it's just that some people expect to see German or Japanese design and this has a Swedish mentality to it.   Basic, sparse, but high quality.  Negatives would be that the transmission is a little lazy in regular mode.  Sport mode sure solves that, but at the expense of holding lower gears a little longer than you'd like in routine driving.  But for spirited driving, it's great.  Another issue would be that the bluetooth streaming will cut out for a second every now and then at first, then eventually settle down and work well.    The Nav is a disgrace, The 5 year warranty with full maintenance we got free during a summer promotion helps offset the biggest negative, the poor resale value.    We thought about trading ours for a V60 but found it was worth about $10,000 less than we paid for it after a year.   This will flatten out, but for some reason all Volvos seem to take a steep initial drop in value, and some, like the S60, keep dropping.     We paid about $6500 less than MSRP in 2014.Overall, besides the BMW 328i, which will cost a little more and be a little less quick,  I wouldn't seriously consider another make for this specific class of car.  However, I do prefer slightly larger vehicles for the interior ""elbow room"".    The BMW will have a bigger back seat.    And yes, Volvos are built like vaults.   Very solid.

Super safe, very smart, reliable, great breaking, very good on the road. The only reason i am on this web site is that i did not negotiate my lease well enough and my lease payoff is way too high to keep my car. But over all this is my third Volvo, the previous was s60 2012 and it drove slightly different (they change the wheel to electric one on 2015) also 2015 is way more safer. It will get you spoiled in terms of standard safety features. The ones i personally use the most are: BLIS (blind spot aid), cross traffic (it's when you are pulling out of your parking spot and dont see the approaching cars in the isle - the car spots them and if needed automatically applies breaks), citi traffic feature is very useful too - it applied breaks a couple of times when my car approached another car too close in slow to semi-slow moving traffic. The seats are ... can i get one like those for my living room please? I drove about 10 times from DC to NY and back and never felt tired sitting in the car. Breaks are super, the car stops on a spot! the road handling is very good too - i feel safe in a rain or snow. However you need to be careful when there is a lot of snow - back in Snowmageddon of 2016 I was driving home when there was already about 3 inches of fresh snow on a road and car was swaying from side to side just a little bit. Having said that, navigation is horrible - routinely would tel me to make an exit from the left last second when i am in the far right line, or to save my money would take me back streets instead of the paid highway (even though settings set to the shortest route) (and that's exactly why, by the way, i ended up driving in 3 inches of snow back in 2016), or you will have to use that rotating knob to enter the address for about 15 minutes and then the system would tell you ""no such street"" or offer you another building. You will be better off using apple maps. Ride is a bit on a stiff side, but what do you want from the very cute tank? And that's exactly how I think of my car - it is a very cute, very smart tank with lots of babble wrap inside to protect me.  I am currently shopping around.  Audi A4 looks very dull compared to my car (everybody said the ride is much better, I tried Q3 - and its not THAT much better). BMW 300 series and merc C300 both drive nicer, but way more pricier and not as safe. XC-60 is just like my car, I feel totally home in it - but brakes are slightly weaker and headlights are not as good too. I mean, its a very very nice car, I have hard time being completely swept away by other cars in the same class. Cons: navigation sucks, slightly stiff ride, and apparently volvos in general depreciate very fast and loose value, so if i will get a new volvo - i am driving it to the ground. From the consumer reports reviews i know that 2015 is probably was one of the worst quality wise years (nothing major, just small stupid things that drove people nuts - like oil lamp is on, nothing wrong with the car, but its still on, stuff like that) but my car so far hasn't given me a second of grief. Also I have one of the prettiest combinations of black paint with red shine in it and light leather inside - so pretty!

Being a baby-boomer having driven for many years I originally felt the safety technology would be an unnecessary distraction and possibly an outright annoyance, but having driven the vehicle only 2,600 miles I'm sold on it. The blind-spot and cross-traffic alerts are unobtrusive and the auto-brake tends to be in-sync with my own braking habits. The few times the auto-brake has engaged have been within a fraction of a second before applying the brake myself. The interior materials are high quality and the fit-and-form are excellent. Little extras such as the entry/exit lighting and theater lighting while driving are nice touches that add to the luxury feel of the vehicle, as do the soft-touch premium leather seats. For audio buffs (as I am), the Harman-Kardon audio system is fantastic. While acceleration is strong and smooth when getting heavy on the accelerator the 8-speed transmission is a little disappointing on the lower end of the RPM scale. Under modest acceleration the transmission shifts prematurely (in my opinion) and gives the impression of ""lugging"" the engine. Accelerating somewhat strongly to avoid the feel of ""lugging"" the engine has thus far produced an average city/highway MPG of 31.4, which is all-the-more impressive being a ""green"" engine. The 19-inch diamond-cut wheels look great and provide excellent handling with little additional road noise but do enhance the impact of bumps and rough road surfaces, a price I was willing to pay for the great handling. Overall I would highly recommend the S60.

We were looking for a car for long trips up to Canada that is both comfortable and fuel efficient.  I looked at Lexus, Audi and VW cars (we had a Honda, and had a bad reliability experience with the Mercedes E320 wagon).   The Audi is more quiet, but has a smaller interior with a smaller fuel tank - for long trips we really appreciated both the larger cabin, and the good fuel mileage.  We recently did 1000 miles up to Canada and back and can testify that the car performed very well.  Our son was comfortable in the back reading - in the Honda he got motion sickness.   In particular, while some journalists do not like the adaptive cruse control, I found it fantastic - once one gets use to using it, it makes long drives on moderately busy freeways much much more enjoyable and stress free.  The S60L has a longer wheel base which reduce handling, but increases stability - the car performed perfectly on busy highways with large trucks that can blow a car around.  Many journalists complained about the lack of a touch screen - I strictly preferred the S60 to both the S90 and Audi A4- the navigation screen is perfect - I find the heads up display very distracting, and once one gets the hang of it, the S60 system is efficient - the hardest thing to do is enter an address, but with Volvo on call this is easy - find the address on ones phone and then send to the car. The negatives are the following - small trunk - holds about 4 roll-ons plus a bit  - we got the spare tire that reduces trunk space (which for long trips is something we value - being stuck on a highway with a flat at 2am is not great).  Second, one can put a Class 2 hitch for a bike rack or cargo carrier, but for the moment there are no roof racks for the Inscription - Rhino Rack says they may do them in the future, but Thule (and hence Volvo) says they will not do them - so I would not recommend the car for a family that needs more space - with roof racks and a cargo box, the car could be a good family car - large cabin plus comfortable, but precise ride.  Finally, the car can use regular gas, but 89 octane gets 12% better mileage, so we will use that going forward. Overall, we would get the same car again, unless there is a V60 Inscription, which would solve the lack of cargo space, while giving more cabin space.Update August 2018:  Our initial impressions have not changed much.  The following seemingly small issues would probably lead me to buy a different car this time:1. Headlights are not great - it would be nice to have running lamps - I have these on my other car and have found that they do improve driving in the fog and snow.  Volvo used to have these, but no longer.2. We did use the spare on the way to the airport and so it saved us from missing a flight - wish they would make more room for a spare.  3. Still no rack for the car.  Really irritating, especially if  one skis.   I put a hitch on for a bike rack that I do us frequently, and had a wiring harness put in for towing - Volvo does not support these, so it was after market.  4. Windshield wipers are not very good, and given the unusual specs I could not find an aftermarket pair that would do better.Overall, it is a nice car, but for the American market Volvo really seems to want to force people to large gas guzzler's for car's that have utility features .  A sedan is great for day to day driving, and the extra room in the back is very nice.  However, for holidays one would like more usability features - overhead rack, better wipers, better lights.

I knew of their existence but never did a double take. My company leases their vechicles to the employees as a company vehicle. Then when mileage hits 85-90k miles, they first offer it to the original driver of our company, then to any other employee in the company. I just happened to check the listings in Phoenix, AZ and the first one on the list was a 2012 Volvo S60 T5 Flamenco Metallic Red. Then I saw it was our branch manager. I walked over and asked him how he liked the car and said he loved it and threw me the keys and said ""see for yourself"". I was so excited once I sat in the amazing leather cockpit and slapped in the boxy key and hit start. He had a smile on his face as he walked away knowing I would probably enjoy the drive. The handling was great! The acceleration was great! Oh, then I noticed sport mode. That really helped me decide about the purchase. So after cranking the 8 speaker stereo with upgraded 160 watt amp, and opening and closing the sunroof / moonroof...I was hooked. I kinda said under my breathe...Volvo, for life. I have had the car now for about 1 month and I am still not tired of driving it. The controls in the console are easy to use. The power seats are a treat. The solid state hard drive I plugged in to the USB port in the center hidden console supplies me with 256GB of tunes that will last on any road trip without repeating a song. By the way, the first thing I did for maint was replace the headlights with a little whiter shades, replaced the spark plugs with double platinum. Replace the cabin filter (not fun at all). And polish up the leather seats for a nice new look. I did notice that the newer 2014-2016 speedometer cluster was easy to swap out but a few features would not show up so I decided to keep the old cluster and enjoy the simple yet semi-sporty look.

After test drive, the Volvo S60 Inscription stands out to be my top choice: it has the most head room for me and it is easily one of the smoothest to drive at all speed range. Standard features include leather interior, HD radio,  rear window sunshades, city safety and glass sun roof etc.ExteriorThe 18"" titanium wheels look handsome and provide very good ride quality. The tall roof line makes entering and existing the car extremely easy. The car looks small from outside while roomy inside.InteriorHigh quality leather seats, simple yet elegant color combination is pleasant to my eyes. The sit position is more upright compared to other cars, together with excellent all-round support and wide adjustment range from the seat as well as from the steering wheel, easily provide the most comfortable experience among all the cars I've tested. The silk metal trim gives solid and luxuries feeling, the steering wheel has the perfect size, it feels really good in hands.DrivingI own a Honda accord and my first impression driving the S60 is that the cabin is whisper quiet, much quieter than my Honda. The acceleration feels like a powerful V6,  the S60 feels very solid on road. It does not have much body roll when making turns, at the same time it filters uneven road surface nicely.Safety featuresSafety feature includes the ability to stabilize the car in case of a flat tire; also good space between the front bumper and the radiator that can reduce damage in case of low speed accident (There is a sticker on the rear window of the passenger side that indicates the car's rear and front bumpers are designed to withstand 3 miles/hour hit limit, which exceeds the standard 2.5 mile/hour limit, which result in no structure damage and minimum bumper damage that can be fixed easily ); the city safety triggered once when a biker cuts in front of my car when my car was moving slowly, nice!EntertainmentI loaded all my music collections on to a USB stick and plugin to the USB port in center console. The album name, album photo and track names are displayed on the LCD screen. I can now enjoy the high quality music on my daily commute.Overall the S60 inscription is an elegant car that meets all my requirements, it provides an extremely well balanced experience that makes the daily drive a true joy.Update (11-19-2016):The combined MPG is now 29.4 at 3316 miles, compared to 28.4 at 1800 miles, my daily commute includes mountain road with  a lot of up and downs.

Volvo does front seats better than anyone in my opinion; these are sculpted and amazingly supportive in beechwood/black leather. The feel of the car is luxurious, tight, quiet and cocoon-like but it gives you a sense of being in touch with the road and very much in control. Consumer Reports recommends this car and says reliability is ""better than average."" This trim line comes with  an excellent Harmon Kardon stereo with 12 speakers, LOADS of safety features and electronics; my car insurance went DOWN 25% due to Volvo's safety record! The lighting throughout the cabin--which is very important to me--is really nice...with foot well lights front and back and lots of little ambient lighting touches throughout. The center console storage area feels small to me and is a little too vertical in comparison to my last car. The car feels welcoming and calming inside with its beautiful Scandinavian design cues and subtle luxury touches. This car has the extra 3"" wheelbase and therefore backseat room which is really nice. It feels sporty and nimble and can take corners quickly without a squeal but isn't a sports car per se. I shopped Audi A4, Lexus 250, BMW 328 and Volvo felt like the best overall choice for me in European sport sedans. (Most striking to me was that the current A4 was rated ""poor"" in one critical IIHS front collision test!) The Volvo trunk is spacious. This car comes with intelligent cruise control, backup camera, parallel parking assist, Volvo's BLIS system, keyless entry, fold-up outside mirrors, home link, navigation and mine has the 19"" alloy wheels with big Pirelli tires. I will check in again in six months and hopefully still be as happy then as I am now with my S60.UPDATE: Six months in, I am still very glad I got my S60 Inscription! It is quick, nimble, very comfortable to drive in city & on the open road. The safety systems are superb & work exactly as designed! The radar-controlled smart cruise control amazes me every time I use it & the sensors front & rear and side-to-side make any parking pickle a breeze. And those industry-leading Volvo front seats do not disappoint. Awesome audio, too. The only small complaints I have are: some creaking in the interior on the rear right side of the cabin (although no squeaks or rattles of any kind) and I find that the wiper/washer/headlight washer system sprays excessive amounts of windshield spray which doesn't drain off the car properly & requires numerous wiper swipes to clear.

It is just an all-around competent vehicle that is a pleasure to get in and drive everyday. It has a super high quality feel - like it's built very solid, something I didn't get in my Accord or Camry Hybrid.

There is no way to put enough luggage in the trunk for anything more than a weekend and anything bigger than an infant in the back seat is a joke. Ironically, the only people that would fit in the back seat only make the lack of trunk space worse because they require even more stuff. Fuel economy on a vehicle of this size is awful. I owned a Accord before this vehicle and the mileage was on average 35% better for a vehicle that was bigger and older. The audio controls are confusing and lack simple functions. The Volvo system stores information some logical and some not so logical places.

But first some background. My job is in the automotive electronics world, so working with car companies and design engineers is what I do 50 hours a week. What most engineers will tell you over dinner is that Volvo's have and do have the most solid design in the world. What that means is that they favor safety and long-term reliability over short-term aesthetics and performance. Here is where the problem begins. There are large segments of car buyers and this one fails to hit a big group. I'll get to that later. But here goes my personal review.This is an awesome car, but I'll give my 3 small criticisms. 1. The backseat. There are no 2 ways around this. The backseat is comfortable but insanely small. If you're over 5ft 8 inches, people will be uncomfortable sitting behind you. 2. The instrument cluster/infotainment. The speedometer takes a little getting used to. I'd expect a digital one to be honest, but you don't get it here. Can't say why its off a little, but its a minor annoyance.3. Front seats. This is really dependent on the person. I'm 6ft 5in, so I'm a big guy. This car has really nice, comfortable seats, but they sit low and the whole car has kind of a low profile. For the extra long trips, comfort is a bit of an issue. But this is really just a big person problem. My wife and brother in law have driven it long distances as normal sized people in great comfort.Now the good. Where do I start. I have the AWD version and live in Minnesota, so you can do the math of how much fun you have when you mix a turbo with AWD in the snow. But that's not unique to this car. What is unique is the build itself. What you'll find when you drive european cars like this is that they just feel tight, from the suspension to the steering. But the S60 has an extra feeling of being just solid and that doesn't wear off. If you care to do so, just open the hood or go underneath it. I've done a little work myself and can tell you that they are meticulously well built and designed. There is a really rugged simplicity to them.  the car is sport, quick and responsive. Don't believe reviewers that tell you otherwise. Simply google the 0-60 and other tests, it performs well. This is where it begins to distance itself from the Audi's and BMWs. These Volvos are best bought by people that plan to own them for a while. the target market is someone who wants a nice European style sedan with Japanese reliability. I've only had to have on repair done and it was the electronic parking brake motor (under warranty). But I can tell you that the repair bills will be nowhere near that of its European cousins, but will be higher than an American or Japanese car. The bottom line is that no matter what you hear or are told by Audi fanboys and the like, the S60 is a better car if you care about long term reliability and affordability. You may get a little more short term spunk from the Audi and BMW counterparts, but the only other place you'll get more is the price tag and the repair bill. There has been a ton of market research on this point and there is a significant segment of the population that buys European cars in this price range. That segment is men, ages 25-40. The main reason they buy them is the name recognition and status. The problem for Volvo is that Audi, BMW and to some extent VW own this space almost completely. There are 2 companies trying to crack that market. Cadillac, with their ATS and Volvo with the S60. Both a failing for the most part. The reason is that they don't have 4 rings or a blue and white badge on the grill. Long review, but I feel this car deserves it. Don't fall victim to the popularity contest.

 on 02/15/16 09:16 AM (PST),Bingham ,1998 Volvo S90 Sedan 4dr Sedan,Classic Swedish Style And Grace," The S90 is the last remaining iconic rear wheel drive Volvos produced and the 1998 model year was its swan song. The S90 production was only about 18 months.This model not only competes very well with its European cousins such as Mercedes, BMW and Audi but excels in overall fit, finish, performance and reliability. The S90 has such understated elegance, that belies its true heritage. Make no mistake it is a true Volvo with safety a paramount issue and was the first to employ side air bags in this model year. Although some 17 years now into service, not many are available in the pre owned market.Many of the S90's were used as transportation for royalty, diplomats, executives and UN duty the world over based upon the safety measures that are employed in the S90 as well as its overall performance in emergency situations. One will feel totally safe in this car. Regardless of going out shopping, or a night on the town or a lengthy road trip, the S90 excels in all climates and situations one may find themselves faced with. With its powerful Porsche designed engine cruising the Interstates is a breeze and has low end torque that will sprint you away quickly. Has the tightest turning radius of any sedan in its class, which means even in the smallest of parking situations the S90 excels with ease. Throughout the years of designing and building cars, Volvo's purpose has remained the same: to deliver its occupants to their destination safely and comfortably. Our 1998 Volvo S90 adds another adverb to that list: stylishly. That's right - the famously boxy buggy lost some of its squareness for this the model year, both literally and figuratively. With this beautiful sedan, Volvo lets style ride in the front seat with safety. In other words, ""Sure, we're the safest, but we're darned good-looking, too."" You've seen these pass you out on the roads, and most likely you've noticed the guy behind the wheel going about his commute with a smile. This is the result of rolling down the road enjoying truly exceptional handling and performance while feeling confident that this vehicle, which received stellar ratings in NHTSA crash tests, will protect you should something go awry. Plus the Narcissus in every driver loves knowing that in this car he looks great doing it, too. Spend awhile behind the wheel and you'll get the feeling this car was made for the highway, where you're sure to be all smiles. The Volvo S90 offers you a great choice if you're shopping for a Sedan with a few extras. Add in the Swedish comfort and impressive performance and you have yourself a winner not often found.S90 Description:Basic Information: Model Year: 1998Make: VolvoModel: S90Body Type: SedanSuspension:Independent Suspension: IndependentStabilizer Bar: Front And RearIn Car Entertainment:Audio System: AM/FM Stereo w/CD & CassetteSpeakers: 8Antenna Type: Power RetractableComfort:Air Conditioning: Automatic Climate ControlTrunk LightsDash Trim: Genuine WoodMats: Carpet Front And RearReading Lights: Front And RearRearview Mirror: Day-NightSteering Wheel Trim: LeatherVanity Mirrors: Driver And PassengerDoors:Front Doors - 2Rear Doors - 2Engine:Engine Description: 2.9L I6 24VFuel Type: Premium GasCam Type: Dual Overhead CamFuel Induction: MPIValves Per Cylinder: 4Aspiration: NormalMPG Automatic City: 18MPG Automatic Highway: 26Instrumentation:SpeedometerClock Fuel Gauge w/low level alertTachometerAmbient Temp LCD Readout with Black Ice Warning that turns display Red.Seats:Seating Capacity: 5Drivers Height: PowerDrivers Lumbar: ManualDrivers Power: 6 way with memoryPassenger Height: PowerPassenger Lumbar: ManualPassenger Power: 6 with memoryFront Seat Type: BucketUpholstery: LeatherPrivacy Pockets: Front Of Both Driver & Passenger SeatsCenter Armrest: With Pass-ThruHeat DuctsHeated Seats: Driver and PassengerFeatures:Floor Covering: Deep Pile CarpetBumpers: Body-ColoredDimensions:Luggage Capacity: 16.60 Cubic FeetMaximum Seating: 5Length: 191.80 InchesWidth: 68.90 InchesHeight: 55.60 InchesWheelbase: 109.10 InchesCurb Weight: 3521 PoundsDriveTrain:Transmission: 4-Speed AutomaticDrive Train Type: RWDDriven Wheels: Rear-WheelWheels Rims: AlloyWheels Spare Rim Type: SteelRoof and Glass:Front Wipers: Fixed & IntervalRear DefoggerRear Windows: PowerSunroof: PowerPrivacy Glass: LightConvenience:Cruise ControlWindows: PowerSteering Power: Hydraulic Power-AssistSteering Adjustment: ManualOutside Remote Mirrors: Power RemotesPower Door Locks: Power With 2 Stage UnlockCupholdersDoor PocketsPower Outlets 1Seatback Storage: 2Memory Features: DriverMemory Features Number of Drivers: 3Keyless EntrySafety:Driver and Passenger AirbagSide Airbags: Seat MountedABS: 4-WheelAnti Theft SystemBrakes: 4 Wheel DiscSafety LocksHeadlights: HalogenHeadlight Cleaners: Wiper And WasherDaytime Running LightsFog Lights: HalogenTurning Circle: 31.80",5.0,"Classic Swedish Style And Grace The S90 is the last remaining iconic rear wheel drive Volvos produced and the 1998 model year was its swan song.

As expected, the price was a bit high, however it is worth every dime!  Having had two prior Volvos, we had certain expectations with this one, and it has surpassed them all.  Classic styling, old-world craftsmanship in its attention to detail assembly, excellent performance and handling, easily the nicest, most driveable vehicle we've had in over 30 years, including a Cadillac.

My 2003 9-5 Aero wagon was a great car to drive, being very comfortable with plenty of cargo space. However at 266k miles, with a daily 90 mile commute, it was time to replace it. I wanted a car as comfortable as it, which is not easy to find. Most cars have poor front seats for long term driving comfort. I like to move around a lot of stuff and need cargo space, hence my interest in only wagons. I briefly considered the 328 wagon - I like its exterior styling, however as typical BMW their seats are uncomfortable to me and you sit too low in the car. My wife recently leased a 320 (drives nice; seats and ergonomics suck), and I sat in every car at the dealer from 2 to 7 series and all of the seats are far less comfortable than those in my V60. I also have a lot of concern about their long-term reliability since I try to keep my cars to 200k+ miles. I also considered the VW Golf wagon, but it wasn't as quiet on the freeway as I would like. I tried and bought a new 2015.5 V60 T5 Drive-E with sport seats and suspension and have enjoyed it every day since I bought it. It's now nearly 3 years old and already has 70k miles and has not had any reliability problems. I recently replaced the tires with the same Pirellis that came with car. It is quiet and smooth at highway speeds and corners tightly and confidently. Front seats are very comfortable and need a little time to break in. Front visibility is great with no glare. I like the control layout and enjoy listening to satellite radio every day. Bluetooth connection to my phone is reliable and telephone sound quality is excellent. My only complaint was the stock acceleration was not quite as strong feeling as I enjoyed with my Saab. However that was fixed and the car transformed when I recently bought the Polestar Performance Optimization software for the car. It can be easily downloaded and installed at any Volvo dealer. With the new software, it now passes very quickly on the freeway while also improving the throttle and transmission behavior. Highway gas mileage in unchanged. This is now one hell of a European car!

The only nit I would pick are the comments about the controls of the Sensus electronics system. The review mentions that the control via a dial on the central instrument panel is less than optimal.  I would agree if this was the only way to control the various systems such as media, navigation, internet, etc.  However, all of these systems can alternatively be controlled via the curled knob and a couple of pads located on the right hand of the steering wheel with your right hand thumb.  Personally, I hardly ever use the dial on the center instrument cluster and use the steering wheel controls for entering radio, sirius, internet, navigation and phone inputs which I feel is at least as convenient as a central console mouse type control because you can leave both hands on the steering wheel while controlling these systems.After 18 months and 22,000 miles of ownership the car is still performing as new.  Gas mileage is averaging about 30 mpg which is exceeding my expectations considering its performance and comfort. The only maintenance has been two Dealer 10K oil changes and checkups at no cost to me. The only changes to the car I would recommend are faster than 3G internet and the cars rather wide turning radius makes parking in tight spots a little challenging. The driver and passenger front seats are very comfortable on all day drives. I have now driven my V60 38,000 miles with no problems.  Only routine 10K service and absolutely no repairs or issues with the car.  I use it primarily for road trips and average over 30 mpg.  The seats are really comfortable on all day drives and the leather looks new but I clean and treat the leather upholstery about twice a year so I'm sure that helps.

 on 03/31/16 17:15 PM (PDT),Vicki ,2016 Volvo V60 Wagon T5 Drive-E Premier 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Immediately Knew It Was My Car," I have spent the last year and a half researching vehicles on line and test driving cars that looked promising.  My focus was on a crossover SUV, with the top three eventually being (in no particular order) the Volvo XC60, Acura RDX and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid.  I test drove all three cars more than once and still couldn't determine a clear favorite.  One evening, I read Edmunds review of the Volvo V60 wagon, which I hadn't researched, but was very interested in the car after reading the review.  I test drove the car a few days later and liked it, and the following weekend, took my spouse to the dealership to try the car, not intending to get one that day.  We were both really impressed with the handling, the zippy drive, and the way it felt on the freeway and on the city streets.  We decided to try the XC60 again while we were there for an immediate comparison, but I got behind the wheel of the V60 one more time and knew it wasn't necessary to drive another car; this one was it, and we drove it home that evening.  Basically, the V60 is very similar to the XC60, just doesn't have the SUV height.  The seats are so comfortable, the dash and instrumentation clear and easy to read, and the best feature for me is the blind spot monitor which is built into the post rather than the side mirror, which I much prefer.  This is a solid vehicle, with excellent pick-up and acceleration and a very smooth ride and very good gas mileage.  I wanted the new safety features available on today's cars which was the reason for the new car, and they are totally worth it.  Backed out of the driveway the other day, and the cross traffic alert let me know that a car was speeding down our street.  Very clear picture in the back-up camera and navigation screen.  All the bells and whistles are easy to program.  V60 scored well on all the safety tests, which was a must for me.  Very happy with the decision, and I am looking for reasons to get in the car and drive it!6-Month Update:  Still love this car.  Seat comfort is outstanding.  We have driven it on a couple of road trips, and the ride is smooth and comfortable.  Air conditioning is spot on, and the sound system is fine, even though we didn't get an upgraded system.  Gas mileage has been good, too, especially on the highway on the trips we have taken.  Two things I particularly love:  the blind spot monitor and the rear view through the back window.  Re the blind spot: the amber light is positioned perfectly on the interior of the car rather than on the outside mirrors as it is on other vehicles.  It is not intrusive at all and is a useful tool when planning to change lanes.  I also really like the view out the back window looking through the rear view mirror.  When the backseat headrests are reclined, it is like looking through a picture window!  Even when the headrests are in the up position, it is still a clear, big view out the back window.  And, the car is fun to drive.  Zippy and responsive.  No complaints or remorse after six months; I really like this car.

 on 01/28/17 08:44 AM (PST),christopher jahn ,2008 Volvo S80 Sedan T6 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),A leather trimmed Tank," The turbo of course takes premium gas.  She's a pig for it at a staggering average of 17 miles to a gallon.  So if you've got an aversion to 60 or 70 dollar fill ups his isn't the Volvo for you.  Additionally she takes synthetic for the first 78k miles and then a blend to 120 making oil change pretty costly for the first few years.  I've had this girl since she was new and I'm trading in for an S90.  It's got 91000 miles and all it ever needed was motor mounts (400.00 bucks) and brakes (600.00 bucks). She's does eat up rear brakes a bit but not at an alarming rate like say an Audi does.  I believe this wear is related to the small pad size and the overall weight of the car. It's a heavy car, probably make mostly of rocks.  Tires will set you back a cool 800.00 bucks because you'll need a low profile extra wide bus tire to take the weight.  The seats are great, better than an S class Mercedes or any Lexus in my opinion. The interior is laid out in an elegant simplicity that is very Swedish and logical giving you a much more relaxed driving experience.  If you like your car to have enough buttons all over the place that it looks like a space ship, get a German car, they dig that look.  Overall this is a good car.  It was reliable beyond anything else, including my old S70, and it has enough power to let you move about with confidence.  My primary gripe would be turning radius.  This car by far has the worst turning radius of any car I've ever owned.  You'll need to take a wide shot to get in and out of spots so it's not for the faint of heart when it comes to parking this big girl.  Additionally the sat radio antenna is weak.  I small stand of trees or a bush easily disrupt the signal. In the end it's a Volvo, they pretty much go forever and I'd recommend even an old one like this as a great used car at a good value.",4.0,"A leather trimmed Tank The turbo of course takes premium gas.

It's a heavy car, probably make mostly of rocks.  Tires will set you back a cool 800.00 bucks because you'll need a low profile extra wide bus tire to take the weight.  The seats are great, better than an S class Mercedes or any Lexus in my opinion. The interior is laid out in an elegant simplicity that is very Swedish and logical giving you a much more relaxed driving experience.  If you like your car to have enough buttons all over the place that it looks like a space ship, get a German car, they dig that look.  Overall this is a good car.  It was reliable beyond anything else, including my old S70, and it has enough power to let you move about with confidence.  My primary gripe would be turning radius.  This car by far has the worst turning radius of any car I've ever owned.  You'll need to take a wide shot to get in and out of spots so it's not for the faint of heart when it comes to parking this big girl.  Additionally the sat radio antenna is weak.  I small stand of trees or a bush easily disrupt the signal. In the end it's a Volvo, they pretty much go forever and I'd recommend even an old one like this as a great used car at a good value.","[('fill ups', 'ups')]","['easily disrupt', 'enough power', 'small stand', 'primary gripe']","[['take'], ['miles'], ['nt', 'miles', 'year', 'take'], ['new'], ['nt', 'miles'], ['like'], ['car'], ['car'], ['take'], ['great'], ['nt'], ['like', 'car'], ['good', 'car'], ['car'], ['nt', 'come', 'take'], ['nt'], ['like', 'good', 'car', 'one', 'great']]","[('78k miles', 'miles'), ('oil change', 'change'), ('motor mounts', 'mounts'), ('pad size', 'size'), ('bus tire', 'tire'), ('S class', 'class'), ('driving experience', 'experience'), ('space ship', 'ship'), ('radio antenna', 'antenna')]","['wide bus tire', 'overall weight', 'enough buttons', 'great car', 'small pad size', 'good car', 'rear brakes', 'good value', 'alarming rate', 'few years', 'staggering average', 'Additionally takes', 'make mostly', 'heavy car', 'wide shot', 'low profile', 'first 78k', 'ever owned', 'go forever', 'extra wide bus tire', 'big girl', 'much go', 'old one', 'first years', 'probably make', 'ever needed', 'relaxed driving experience', 'used car', 'elegant simplicity', 'German car', 'more relaxed driving experience']",pos

I haven't bought a new vehicle in 18 years (drove a 1998 Mitsubishi Montero for that entire time) and I was expecting the offerings to have changed substantially in that time. Instead what I found was pretty looking vehicles with terrible visibility, cheap interiors, frustratingly anemic CVT's and lackluster fuel economy. If I'm going to drive an unresponsive brick I expect it to get close to 30 MPG overall, not 21 city 28 highway. My massive, old clunker of an SUV got 18 city 25 highway and was fast to boot.So I was pretty disillusioned and decided to go have a look at some used vehicles. Our family has had many Volvos and apart from replacing turbo seals (an issue they have apparently resolved since 2001) never had any issues with them at all (and I'm talking not a single one of them has ever failed to start or had a single mechanical failure over about 40 years of combined driving, 5 cars over 8 years each).So I started looking and was quickly interested in the AWD S80's particularly the turbo inline 6 or T6. I test drove a 2008 with 64000 miles and was elated. The car is solid as a tank, looks new, smells new, feels glued to the road and is a ROCKET! I bought the car as soon as we got back to the dealership.The vehicle is a little slow getting through the first 3 gears unless you give it a little more gas but once it's going and especially on the highway, the car is untouchable. By far the fastest most responsive vehicle I've ever driven or ridden in with the exception of a standard BMW M5. The ride is really smooth with almost no body roll even in tight turns and you feel glued to the pavement. The AWD is definitely noticeable versus front and rear wheel drive mostly as a reluctance of the car to deviate from the line it's on until you turn the steering wheel.Like I said in the title, every aspect of this 2008 S80 is nicer than any new 2016 car I test drove and that includes safety features.

The 2015.5 Platinum Drive-E is awesome. The gas mileage is impressive - I got as much as 38.5 mpg on the highway. City mileage generally is not near the EPA estimate of 25 - more like 19.  It is a very understated car - most people do not realize what an exceptional car it is - great ride and comfort. The folding rear seats give you additional room when you need to move something. The headlights are absolutely awesome! - They are very bright and turn as you turn the vehicle. I can attest to the fact that it is a safe car. I was in a major accident and my S80 was totaled (not my fault - another guy ran a red light). It did exactly what it was supposed to do - side curtain airbags deployed but the front ones did not (since by then my speed was reduced when I hit a pole). I am glad the front air bags did not go off when they did not have to - my head never hit the steering wheel. Even though the front-end of the car sustained substantial damage, the air bags did not go off when they didn't need to. My only major complaint about the car was the Volvo On Call App. It was one of the main reasons I bought the car - ability to remote start, send destinations from smart phone to GPS, etc. But the connectivity and Volvo support was not very good. Even though reliability was only around 60-70%, I needed it for the remote start. Prior to the accident I renewed my Volvo On Call for 54 months. I paid $600 for 54 months. After the accident, I realized I had 48 months left on the service that I would not be able to use. I called Volvo to get a refund of the remaining time since I obviously would not be able to use the service since the car was totaled. Volvo said too bad - we have your $600 and are going to keep it even though we know we can't provide you the service.  So as a word of CAUTION, it may be tempting to renew for a longer period of time because $11.11 per month (for 54 months) is more reasonable than $16.67 per month (1 year renewal). However, if anything happens to your car, you could be out a lot of money. It basically cost me $100 per month for the service (used 6 of the 54 months). Not worth $16.67 per month for the service and absolutely not worth $100 per month!! Also, as I understand it, if you sell the car, it is not transferable and the new owner will have to buy the same service again. So not good if you think you might sell the car. Just something to consider should you decide to renew. I was extremely disappointed in Volvo's response to my request for a refund. I will never ever make that mistake again!

First, there is no defined place for sunglasses and they go into a compartment behind the radio or the central bin between the seats.  The compartment behind the radio is most convenient but they fly out when you swing around a sharp corner fast.  I do that a lot.  Second, the cup holders for the front seat are too close together.  As a result, my venti iced latte and my wife's drink like to pop the lid off one another.  Take one for a nice long drive and see if you can return it to the lot.

My son is already 6' at age 14 so space would have been tight for the family in the S60.  I looked at lots of cars and realized i'm not the guy for those that look pompous.  I wanted understated, classy, strong value and safe.   I've got 10k on this now and not one thing has caused me an issue other than figuring out how to setup my Volvo connection account.  Their customer service solved the problem very quickly.   Everyone that rides in it is amazed and says things like ""well, I never"" and ""beautiful"" and ""what kind of car is this again?"".    The technology is significantly advanced over the 2015.   I would purchase it again in a heartbeat.   Two complaints.  First, there is no defined place for sunglasses and they go into a compartment behind the radio or the central bin between the seats.  The compartment behind the radio is most convenient but they fly out when you swing around a sharp corner fast.  I do that a lot.  Second, the cup holders for the front seat are too close together.  As a result, my venti iced latte and my wife's drink like to pop the lid off one another.  Take one for a nice long drive and see if you can return it to the lot.  I could not and look forward to handing this off to my oldest when she graduates college in 7 years.","[('S80 e', 'e'), ('customer service', 'service')]","['almost got', 'bS80 ettS80 er fit', 'solvS80 ed quickly']","[['car'], ['one'], ['like', 'one'], ['drive', 'take'], ['drive', 'nt', 'year', 'car', 'road'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'one'], ['like', 'car', 'one'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'conv'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'like', 'one', 'wife'], ['drive', 'one'], ['year']]","[('gas mileage', 'mileage'), ('Volvo account', 'account'), ('connection account', 'account'), ('cup holders', 'holders')]","['efficient gas mileage', 'following criteria', 'sharp corner', 'long drive', 'zippy performance', 'strong value', 'iced latte', 'professional reviewer', 'nice drive', 'going around', 'bad drivers', 'look forward', 'aggressive driver', 'likely chomping', 'front seat']",pos

The butter soft leather seats are heated, the cab is library quiet.  A handy pass through from the trunk makes the car practical for the occasional trip to the hardware store or more frequent trip to the ski hill.  I've enjoyed one winter, a winter where my hometown of Billings ranked #4 in the nation for snowfall.  The car never faltered, even plowing through seemingly endless series of rutted city streets and making it through the graveled country roads I often travel to see clients.  Now, this 2007 model does not have the now ubiqtuous center stack of video screens and endlessly distracting electronic gew gaws.  The six disk cd changer, superb audio system, and the ability to tie in a ipod or other gadget is wonderful, it is also set up for satellite radio, but I haven't activated it.  Being a child of the 70's and 80's, I enjoy everything from ZZ Top to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, all of which are perfectly enjoyable either in the car or, cranked, two blocks away.  With no distortion whatsoever.  The dash is clean, laid out very well for the driver, the materials, fit and finish are excellent.  The interior lines are best described as understated elegance.   Roadmanners are superb, the twin turbo, 300 hp straight six is a delight to drive.  One arrives at 100 in no time at all, I have no idea what the top speed is.  I do know it is awful fun to pass those long trucks on two lane roads, far more than it was in the Ford Freestyle this car replaced.  Long drives melt away at a delightful clip, 80 is legal in Montana on most Interstates, 85 in good weather doesn't even get you a blink from the local Highway Patrol.  The sunroof is a welcome option.  In short, this is by far the nicest vehicle I've ever owned, and the purchase price of a mere $14k (Volvo's suffer from undeserved depreciation) was the icing on the cake.  I only drive around 15k or so miles per year, so this car should last me, assuming I don't manage to merge with a wayward deer, many years to come.

This is the only SUV I found that gives you the same options as the larger SUVs (I'm a gadget snob) while still giving you a decent size engine to get you there as quick as you want with good gas mileage (for an SUV).

The pros FAR FAR FAR FAR outweigh any of the petty first-world issues I have come across, most of which are to be expected on a first-model year vehicle. The only issues I can find are as follows: CELL PHONE CHARGING: 1) The wireless charger is pretty useless as there is no ventilation in the compartment so it overheats within minutes, 2) with a larger phone (I have a Note 8) you cannot wirelessly charge the phone and use Android Auto (which requires you to use a cable) as there isn't enough physical space, 3) the port to use Android Auto is not fast charging so if you cannot use the wireless charger while using Android Auto, you essentially cannot charge your phone, 4) the only fast charging port in the vehicle is the USB-C facing the rear seats in the center console; LANE KEEP: 1) I find myself ""fighting"" the lane keep assistant as it picks up cracks in the road and is a bit hyper-sensitive at times, even set on the lowest/mildest setting; PANORAMIC MOONROOF: 1) uses a multi-function button that can be overly sensitive and opens things you didn't intend, 2) the screen doesn't always close completely, which may be in part due to the multi-function button trying to open the vent end of the moonroof; DRIVING MODE SETTINGS: 1) The XC40 allows you to set and save individual driving settings (everything from seats to display appearances and driving preferences) and recognizes the driver by the key fob used but, even with this, you still have to change the driving mode setting every time you get in the car (eco mode, performance, etc) - you would think you could make that a default setting with the others; and, finally A/C: 1) other manufacturers have vehicles that do not start air blowing from vents until the air coming out is cool (for A/C) or warm (for heat) but Volvo does not do this so went you turn on the A/C you get outside temp air until the system blows it through and gets to the cool/warm air.

We chose this car after purchasing two BMW X1s in 2014 and 2015. I was a bit worried about the mpg and that I would be consuming more gas and hurting the environment. Well after our first major road trip of 430 miles in CA from N. Ca, through Sacramento to Palo Alto, I was impressed. You have to know that this road trip is primarily major state and federal highways, on roads that are very bumpy, can be stressful, and very heavy with traffic. We obtained an overall round-trip gas mileage of 25.6 mpg with cruising speeds of 70-80 mph, and considerable stop and go on these interstates. Frankly consider this route to be one of the worst traveling itinerary  that you could ever drive and put a car through. The best attribute of this car is the Volvo front car seats that are likely the most comfortable in a car. We purchased the car mostly for the front car seats as my wife has spinal issues that causes her great pain and discomfort about the third hour of a road trip. The seat comfort was the best of what could be expected given my wife's chronic aliments. I cannot say this for the back car seats as they are average, and the designers could have engineered more leg room for the rear passengers. Don't get the wrong impression, it is still better than the X1s that we have experienced.The auto runs smooth, plenty of acceleration, low road noise, and takes the highway bumps with little lingering memory. What I might be critical of is the steering as it is a bit light and you don't have intuitive feeling you get out of a performance car such as a BMW X1. The handling around curves is slightly above average, but you should slow down a bit if it is a tight curve as there is a slight body lean and response for you to take it more slower than a performance car.I have only 700 miles on the car and as you know, nothing is broken in yet, the engine especially. I will look forward to more (pleasurable) road trips and I anticipate that I will find the car much more superior and also expect to obtain slightly higher mpg on long road trips. There are no available safety ratings for this model, but it is a Volvo. The exterior body is very solid and the finish is excellent.

 on 10/09/16 06:31 AM (PDT),James ,2007 Volvo XC70 Wagon 4dr Wagon AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),Go for it!," I bought this car with 99,600 miles on it and paid $9,995, capitalizing on its fairly low resale value.  Since then, I've put over 31,000 miles on it in just a year.  While my fuel economy has not been impressive, especially coming from a 2011 Outback, I have been impressed with what the XC70 has to offer.  Mid-way through the first year I was hit with some high repair costs, as a rear wheel bearing, front ball joint and a tie rod needed to be replaced.  I was initially upset, but once I got the car back all of the things that annoyed me driving it had been fixed!  Sometimes ignorance is not bliss.  Who knew?  This past summer I was living/working in Montana, and took this thing on countless miles of forest service backroads.  It handled things I honestly thought it wouldn't be able too, including an accidental trip on a 4WD only road.  If you're looking at this year range for an Outback or XC70, I would recommend the Volvo.  You can get a lot more for your money in terms of packaging, material quality and comfort.  However, be ready to spend more time as the gas station using premium and the potential for higher maintenance costs.

 on 05/21/16 19:19 PM (PDT),Dave ,2007 Volvo XC70 Wagon 4dr Wagon AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),"2007, The Best Year for XC70"," My current 2007 XC70 is my second; the first was 2004.  All prior model year problems (e.g. transmission) seem to have been fixed on the 2005-2007 model years and '07 was the last year before Ford made Volvo cost reduce the vehicle and substitute the problematic Mitsubishi OEM T6 engine for Volvo's bulletproof 2.5T.  I now have almost 180k miles on this car and my only significant unscheduled repair have been to replace the steering wheel position sensor ""clock spring"" at 148K, fuel rail pressure sensor at around 160K, and the front oxygen sensor at 170K.  At this point (180K miles) I've recently replaced all front suspension bits including front struts, rear shocks, lower front control arms and ball joints and completed a tune up with new plugs and coil packs.  Now, at 180K miles, the car starts, runs, and drives down the road as new   Seats still look practically new.  The chassis is tight and free of rattles.  All in all, a very solid and well built vehicle - very comfortable, big storage in back, and tight if not razor sharp European style handling.  I particularly admire the 2.5T engine.  Torque peak at 1,900 rpm is right at 55mph where you need it for passing.  Light boost turbo maintains power at altitude, yet runs nicely on US regular 87 octane gas - unlike Mercedes, Audi, etc.Good sound system, comfortable seats, intuitive controls, great visibility, sure handling, and higher ride height that makes for easier in/out for us older guys plus eliminates annoying scrapes in front while parking (and you don't plow snow with the front bumper unless it's well over six inches.My only niggle with this vehicle is road noise which can be an issue with most aggressive tread patterns.  Pirelli's P7 AS plus and, just recently, Bridgestone's Turanza Serenity - both Tirerack's highly rated Grand Touring tires - are as quiet as they come with crisp handling and commendable grip in all conditions.  However, I was disappointed in the durability of the Pirelli, the quieter of the two, so recently switched to the Bridgestones.I've considered a newer xc70, but found that about one in 25 of the 3.2 six motors experiences excessive oil burn, leading to ring & piston replacement (no cyl wall scoring) or total engine replacement.  Volvo dealers might tell you that Volvo offers a 4yr/48K mile extended powertrain warranty if you buy a used unit from a dealer; otherwise, good luck.Another age related repair was to replace the upstream oxygen sensor at 170K and, subsequently, the catalytic converter.Finally, if you read the owner blogs Dealers are often referred to as ""the Stealership"".  I've found them capable but very expensive.  Could be worse if you have a Mercedes or Audi.",5.0,"2007, The Best Year for XC70 My current 2007 XC70 is my second; the first was 2004.

Now, at 180K miles, the car starts, runs, and drives down the road as new   Seats still look practically new.  The chassis is tight and free of rattles.  All in all, a very solid and well built vehicle - very comfortable, big storage in back, and tight if not razor sharp European style handling.  I particularly admire the 2.5T engine.  Torque peak at 1,900 rpm is right at 55mph where you need it for passing.  Light boost turbo maintains power at altitude, yet runs nicely on US regular 87 octane gas - unlike Mercedes, Audi, etc.Good sound system, comfortable seats, intuitive controls, great visibility, sure handling, and higher ride height that makes for easier in/out for us older guys plus eliminates annoying scrapes in front while parking (and you don't plow snow with the front bumper unless it's well over six inches.My only niggle with this vehicle is road noise which can be an issue with most aggressive tread patterns.  Pirelli's P7 AS plus and, just recently, Bridgestone's Turanza Serenity - both Tirerack's highly rated Grand Touring tires - are as quiet as they come with crisp handling and commendable grip in all conditions.  However, I was disappointed in the durability of the Pirelli, the quieter of the two, so recently switched to the Bridgestones.I've considered a newer xc70, but found that about one in 25 of the 3.2 six motors experiences excessive oil burn, leading to ring & piston replacement (no cyl wall scoring) or total engine replacement.  Volvo dealers might tell you that Volvo offers a 4yr/48K mile extended powertrain warranty if you buy a used unit from a dealer; otherwise, good luck.Another age related repair was to replace the upstream oxygen sensor at 170K and, subsequently, the catalytic converter.Finally, if you read the owner blogs Dealers are often referred to as ""the Stealership"".  I've found them capable but very expensive.  Could be worse if you have a Mercedes or Audi.","[('T engine', 'engine'), ('Torque peak', 'peak'), ('blogs Dealers', 'Dealers')]","['often referred', 'particularly admire', 'Finally referred']","[['nt', 'second'], ['year'], ['vehicle', 'year'], ['nt', 'miles', 'car'], ['nt', 'miles', 'new'], ['drive', 'miles', 'car', 'new', 'road'], ['vehicle'], ['nt', 'like', 'etc'], ['nt', 'great'], ['vehicle', 'road'], ['nt', 'come', 'one'], ['nt', 'one'], ['one', 'new'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'good'], ['nt', 'conv']]","[('model year', 'year'), ('year problems', 'problems'), ('model years', 'years'), ('OEM T6', 'T6'), ('T6 engine', 'engine'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('wheel position', 'position'), ('position sensor', 'sensor'), ('clock spring', 'spring'), ('fuel rail', 'rail'), ('rail pressure', 'pressure'), ('pressure sensor', 'sensor'), ('oxygen sensor', 'sensor'), ('K miles', 'miles'), ('suspension bits', 'bits'), ('control arms', 'arms'), ('ball joints', 'joints'), ('coil packs', 'packs'), ('K miles', 'miles'), ('octane gas', 'gas'), ('sound system', 'system'), ('ride height', 'height'), ('road noise', 'noise'), ('tread patterns', 'patterns'), ('Touring tires', 'tires'), ('oil burn', 'burn'), ('cyl scoring', 'scoring'), ('wall scoring', 'scoring'), ('engine replacement', 'replacement'), ('Volvo dealers', 'dealers'), ('K mile', 'mile'), ('powertrain warranty', 'warranty'), ('oxygen sensor', 'sensor')]","['unscheduled repair', 'regular octane gas', 'well built', 'front struts', 'sharp style', 'good luck', 'European style', 'recently switched', 'annoying scrapes', 'significant repair', 'new plugs', 'However disappointed', 'only niggle', 'solid vehicle', 'front control arms', 'lower control arms', 'front position pressure oxygen oxygen sensor', 'most aggressive tread patterns', 'crisp handling', 'prior year problems', 'rear shocks', 'comfortable seats', 'Now starts', 'highly rated', 'recently replaced', 'older guys', 'still look', 'intuitive controls', 'runs nicely', 'total engine replacement', 'very solid vehicle', 'only repair', 'big storage', 'aggressive tread patterns', 'excessive oil burn', 'problematic T6 engine', 'front bumper', 'great visibility', 'upstream position pressure oxygen oxygen sensor', 'very comfortable storage', 'sure handling', 'comfortable storage', 'higher ride height', 'last model year', 'Good sound system', 'front suspension bits', 'new Seats', 'easier out', 'replace subsequently', 'used unit', 'catalytic converter']",pos

The swedes know how to build a car - the leather on the seats is very thick, very little plastic is used, and metal covers the exterior of the car. As much as I loved the car, I did have some issues with it. 1st, the siren went out and caused the sunroof to stop working (if you don't believe me, google it), and the check engine light came on once because the gas cap needed to be replaced. Neither of these issues cost very much money to fix, however.  The car did have a little over 100,000 miles, so a few repairs are acceptable since Volvo cars will outlast any others if you take care of them. The other thing that I didn't like about the car was its fuel economy. I was averaging 21 MPG - might as well get an XC90. This car is really for those of us who don't buy into the SUV craze, but still need a light off-road vehicle with plenty of cargo space. The thing that really won me over on Volvo was safety.

 on 08/06/16 14:59 PM (PDT),AnnetteW ,2016 Volvo XC70 Wagon T5 Premier 4dr Wagon AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6A),Beautiful new XC70," Love my new Volvo XC - after driving my 2001 V40 with over 172,000!  Before buying also considered a Subaru Forester and Subaru Crosstrek.  What sold me on the Volvo was the longer warranty period - 4 years/50,000 miles; 12 year rust protection - I live in Western Massachusetts where they salt and sand profusely in the winter; and the alloy wheels.  The interior is so luxurious to me and the people at Gengras Volvo in East Hartford gave me the best deal compared to 2 other Volvo dealers.  I won't really know how the AWD does in winter because I just got the car - so far the handling is stable; and because the wheelbase and size are larger than my old V40 I am adjusting to how it handles with parking and taking the curves - still breaking it in with only 302 miles so far.  The other thing that sold me was the cargo design and layout - my goal is to get to some National Parks to camp in the future - and the 250 horsepower and ability to tow were also part of my decision.  And I love the turbo - my V40 has such great pep - and I have loved that capacity.  The XC70 does weigh more - so haven't tested the pep of the turbo yet - still being cautious as I adjust to the new height - but love being able to just get in the car - rather than have to lower my body as I did in my V40.  And I just get out - so getting in and out is pretty neutral.  Love the proximity package and can see that when my hands are full it will be a blessing; the tailgate with auto up and down - fantastic! And the flat trunk - great for tailgating and picnics.  All the new technology - navigation; phone; etc. - I am still learning how to use this - so can't really make a call on this yet - plus this stuff didn't exist on my 2001 V40. And have to get the new garage door opener programmed yet - that's how new it is to me.One year later - and I still LOVE my new XC 70!!  Currently, I have over 18,000 miles! The XC70 was a real champion in the winter - I was on a small hill and the lead car at the stop light was spinning and going no where - there was one car in between - I backed up my XC70 and with my AWD went around both cars up the same hill and went on my way!! Then I drove through a blowing snow storm down to New Jersey and again, the XC 70 made the trip - it is wonderful and the AWD is fantastic!  Before buying I had checked out the difference in the Haldex versus symmetrical drive - and I am convinced that the Haldex is the way to go.  Over the summer I was also able to test out the turbo when passing on some two lane roads in North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio and it has pep to get around when needed - on two lane roads I don't take time to pass - so the turbo punch does an amazing job and does it well considering the size and weight.  Still leaning to adjust to the new features, but the back up camera is one that has helped so much - it is a great feature and the hands free telephone is wonderful.  Other features that have come in handy - the remote start and the ability to lock the car from afar or to be sure it's locked - especially after parking at the airport.  Still adjusting to the higher center of gravity - especially as I was driving through West Virginia on some very long up and down curves - but it performed beautifully.  The car has been to Northern Michigan, across part of Canada and New York state!  When going across Canada - I was trying to figure out how to get the odometer to switch to kilometers per hour - still have to look that one up - so I turned to the fuel consumption feature where I based my best guess when it indicated I was consuming 100 kmh to estimate the speed I should be going.  Compared to my old low road hugging V40 - it takes time to learn how to steer a car with a higher center of gravity and higher ground clearance - which I need for the snow - but as I am learning - the car is performing beautifully.  And I am so happy with the service department at the Gengras Volvo dealer in East Hartford.   One year later - and know I made the right decision to buy the XC70!!  I can't believe they still don't make this car!Okay, my odometer now reads 28,921 - I have been racking up the miles. Still love my XC70 and it has taken everywhere I need to go up and down the East coast - summer, winter, fall and spring. And amazingly it still cranked this winter when the temperatures hung in the -10 to -18 range for three weeks in the morning. The folks at Genevaâs Volvo are still doing a great job for all me service and I couldnât be happier with my ânewâ Volvo.",5.0,"Beautiful new XC70 Love my new Volvo XC - after driving my 2001 V40 with over 172,000!

Over the summer I was also able to test out the turbo when passing on some two lane roads in North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio and it has pep to get around when needed - on two lane roads I don't take time to pass - so the turbo punch does an amazing job and does it well considering the size and weight.  Still leaning to adjust to the new features, but the back up camera is one that has helped so much - it is a great feature and the hands free telephone is wonderful.  Other features that have come in handy - the remote start and the ability to lock the car from afar or to be sure it's locked - especially after parking at the airport.  Still adjusting to the higher center of gravity - especially as I was driving through West Virginia on some very long up and down curves - but it performed beautifully.  The car has been to Northern Michigan, across part of Canada and New York state!  When going across Canada - I was trying to figure out how to get the odometer to switch to kilometers per hour - still have to look that one up - so I turned to the fuel consumption feature where I based my best guess when it indicated I was consuming 100 kmh to estimate the speed I should be going.  Compared to my old low road hugging V40 - it takes time to learn how to steer a car with a higher center of gravity and higher ground clearance - which I need for the snow - but as I am learning - the car is performing beautifully.  And I am so happy with the service department at the Gengras Volvo dealer in East Hartford.   One year later - and know I made the right decision to buy the XC70!!  I can't believe they still don't make this car!Okay, my odometer now reads 28,921 - I have been racking up the miles. Still love my XC70 and it has taken everywhere I need to go up and down the East coast - summer, winter, fall and spring. And amazingly it still cranked this winter when the temperatures hung in the -10 to -18 range for three weeks in the morning.

You see, a couple of years ago I had to bite the bullet and trade in my 08 XC90 for a Chrysler Town and Country minivan because of the kids. As minivans go, it's great, but... it's a minivan. So for my 40th, my wife said that we could trade in her '15 Subaru Forester for the new XC90! I test drove the 90 and it was great - really nice, but just a little too fancy. See, I'm an avid fly fisherman and I was having trouble picturing this very fancy SUV with muddy boots and waders in the back and mud all over the sides. Besides, I think the new '90 lost a lot of its ""Volvoness"". The XC70 on the other hand - beautiful classic Volvo. Just as comfortable on the side of a river as it is going out to dinner and a show in the city. So I test drove it and fell in love. The whole experience made it feel like the car was made for me. So we traded in the Forester, which I never quite fit into comfortably (I'm 6', 280lbs, but I carry it well ;) ), and leased the XC70. I picked up the car on New Year's Eve, 2015 and have been loving every bit of it for about a month now. The built in booster seats are awesome for the kids, the fold down passenger seat means I don't have to break down my fly rods to get them in the car, the iPhone app is ridiculously useful, I drove it in the Blizzard of '16 and it handled it like the ""blizzard"" of '15, I was a little worried about the lack of touch screen but having gotten used to the controls on the steering wheel I found them to be so much easier - especially with the rhino hooves that I have for hands!

 on 02/29/16 19:36 PM (PST),Robert Zamenhof ,2011 Volvo XC70 Wagon T6 4dr Wagon AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),Why I just purchased a second 2011 XC70 T6," Overall this is a pretty good car. Having had only Volvo wagons since 1980, I have to say that this 2011 seems more solid and heavy (in a good way) than any of my previous models or later models I have driven as loaners. Generally reliability has been good--with a few exceptions: At 85,000 miles, the engine started to use a lot of oil. Volvo examined it and replaced the entire engine. They told me that it was a bad batch of piston rings that was responsible, so this wasn't really a ""bad"" feature of the car. Volvo has never been able to properly balance the wheels, so I have learned to live with a slight steering wheel vibration at around 60 mph. They said the rims were distorted and sent them for repair; but that didn't help. Tire Rack replaced all 4 tires TWICE, with no improvement. The design of the rims is such that mud stays put and makes the balance problem markedly worse. I have never been totally happy with the brakes, but a recent full brake replacement has fixed this problem. There is a really stupid feature of the software: when the fog lights are on, they go out when high beams are selected, but don't come back on when you return to low beams. Interestingly, the second identical model I just purchased doesn't do this! Finally, I am singularly unimpressed with the headlights, specially the high beams. I've replaced the low-beam bulbs with high intensity ""silver tip"" bulbs, but see hardly any difference. There are no high intensity replacements for the high-beam bulbs, so when I drive at night plplllI envy the bright headlights of much cheaper cars.LlLL2nd Review 9/1/16:L having now owned my 2nd 2011 XC70 T6 for about 6 months, I can add a little to this review. The 2nd XC70 seems just as well built as my first one. I do, however, miss the folding rear-view mirrors and the front seats don'r seem to be quite as comfortable; but since the car has less than 30,000 miles, it could just be a break-in phenomenon. The headlights are markedly superior to those on the first car (see above review), even with standard bulbs, and there are no problems with wheel balance or braking (see above review). The silly fog-light phenomenon I described for the first car is also absent.  In summary, the 2nd car is just as good as the first, and just as robust and ""heavy"" in a good way. I'd like to replace the first car with another 2011 (it has 130,000 miles); but I don't think I could find a low-mileage 2011 again.Since the first review (see above), the first car has had the following major repairs (all covered by an extended warranty policy): New A/C compressor, new motor for driver's side mirror (motor failed).",5.0,"Why I just purchased a second 2011 XC70 T6 Overall this is a pretty good car.

Even with how many miles my car has on it, it still tighter and better performing than some new cars. However, this is granted if one pays for the enormous maintenance costs, especially at higher mileage. This car doesn't ever break... it just reaches times when parts naturally wear out and need replaced as per the routine maintenance schedule. But these parts are all very expensive, and all break at once. I cannot complain about the drivetrain, as it has been fantastic. I mean this: I have had no repairs on the engine and transmission the entire time I've owned it. The majority of my extreme maintenance costs have been suspension related. All of the control arms and wheel bearings broke at the same time, as did the shocks and struts. Close to 5 grand in repairs. If you wish to run this car correctly, it takes only synthetic oil, and only premium gas. The nose-bleed expenses aside, this car is a true gem to drive and has never let me down on the road. Always has loads of grip. Has driven through its fair share of blizzards, torrential downpours and sunny days. Is always just as fun and comfortable as the day I bought it.

This car doesn't ever break... it just reaches times when parts naturally wear out and need replaced as per the routine maintenance schedule. But these parts are all very expensive, and all break at once. I cannot complain about the drivetrain, as it has been fantastic. I mean this: I have had no repairs on the engine and transmission the entire time I've owned it. The majority of my extreme maintenance costs have been suspension related. All of the control arms and wheel bearings broke at the same time, as did the shocks and struts. Close to 5 grand in repairs. If you wish to run this car correctly, it takes only synthetic oil, and only premium gas. The nose-bleed expenses aside, this car is a true gem to drive and has never let me down on the road. Always has loads of grip. Has driven through its fair share of blizzards, torrential downpours and sunny days. Is always just as fun and comfortable as the day I bought it. In summary, this car is like a sick pet: it costs you a lot at the vet, but it was money well spent because you love it, and want it to be around for years to come.",[],['break once'],"[['nt', 'miles', 'car', 'test'], ['miles', 'car', 'new'], ['nt', 'one'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'car', 'take'], ['drive', 'car', 'road'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['bought'], ['nt', 'like', 'come', 'year', 'car', 'one', 'love']]","[('time owner', 'owner'), ('mileage car', 'car'), ('maintenance costs', 'costs'), ('maintenance schedule', 'schedule'), ('maintenance costs', 'costs'), ('premium gas', 'gas'), ('nose bleed', 'bleed'), ('bleed expenses', 'expenses')]","['fair sh', 'synthetic oil', 'many miles', 'naturally wear', 'high mileage car', 'never let', 'extreme maintenance maintenance costs', 'very reliable mileage car', 'better performing', 'sunny days', 'routine maintenance schedule', 'entire time', 'long time', 'true gem', 'same time', 'very high mileage car', 'new mileage cars', 'ever break', 'higher mileage', 'enormous maintenance maintenance costs', 'run correctly', 'well spent', 'sick pet', 'torrential downpours', 'want around', 'reliable mileage car', 'However granted', 'only oil']",pos

 on 11/24/15 11:32 AM (PST),Dylan ,2005 Volvo S40 Sedan T5 AWD 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Great Alternative Sports Sedan!," For the past year I have been pulling my hairs out trying to determine what my next car would be. I am a car enthusiast so naturally I have a lot of favorites pulling at my heartstrings which made choosing a vehicle to replace my dependable 2005 Civic would be very difficult! I laid out the criteria I wanted: powerful engine, AWD drivetrain, compact, reliable daily driver. Sure there are some great cars that meet these like the Subaru WRX, Mitsubishi EVO, or entry-level Audis, but the truth is I wanted to own something more unique because I like to stand out. The aforementioned competitors are a lot more common are starting to feel oversaturated in the world of car culture. Not many AWD compact sedans exist, so naturally the Volvo S40 appeared to be my only option. I went for it on a whim and ended up with a beautiful 2010 R-Design with the ever-exciting T5 engine of course! So far, I am not really disappointed. The car does everything I wanted it too and even a bit more. I'm not 100% satisfied with the way it looks as it is a dated (2004, 08 refresh) design. I don't understand why Volvo dramatically updated the C30 and C70 styling but left the S40 kind of bland for its last 3 years... However, it is still a nice looking vehicle with cute yet aggressive proportions. Interior looks amazing though! A lot of people harken it to IKEA as a joke, but they aren't too far off. The interior is sleek, modern, and beautifully simple. The materials are wonderfully rich and well put together. It feels like you're in a much more expensive car with all the great driver amenities and the excellent climate control and booming stereo system. Trunk space is a little small compared to my last car (especially the opening) but it is sufficient for hauling most things. I will say the rear seats can be kind of cramped with the front seats extended backward. The car is awesome to drive. Not quite as fast as a WRX or EVO, but has potential to run with them with a few easy modifications. The T5 engine is noisy, but in the good sort of way that it gurgles in the low RPMs to remind you how sporty it wants to be. The S40 AWD handles really good and flat and so far has proven to have some great traction on slick surfaces. The brakes feel a little bit grabby and fade under hard braking, but do the job. The seats work well to keep you comfortable, even though the car's great handling comes at a cost of being very stiff and it likes to jar itself over small bumps in the road. Overall a very impressive car so far! I have not had any issues except for the oil cooler which the previous owner damaged on a curb. It was only a $120 fix locally and I am no longer dripping oil from it.2016 Update: Since purchasing the car a little over the year ago it has had a plethora of maintenance issues and expensive repairs. when the car hit 94,000 miles, my PCV oil box failed (a common issue on these cars, but Volvo only extended the warranty on < 2008 models so my 2010 was not covered) The repair was costly and as a result of changing oil pressures, it cause my leaky cam seals to finally burst and now the car has a critical oil leak. The cam seal repair requires removal of the timing belt and water pump so prepare to do all of those replacements at once for a quoted dealer cost over $2000. I'm not sure all S40s would have this problem... but if your PCV box fails, it is likely you will experience similar issues with oil pressure drops and leaks. Also, the car randomly started having stalling issues when you shift too quickly into drive. Kind of an annoying problem that I have not found a fix for yet and left the volvo dealership puzzled... All in all, it has been an extremely costly car to own. I recommend the s40/c30/v50 only for the dedicated Volvo owners. Find one with less than 75,000 miles on it and you'll be okay. But I can't quite call the car ""unreliable"" because it starts up 100% of the time and despite all of these issues, it drives like nothing is wrong! The car doesn't seem to be bothered! I think a lot of people confuse ""reliability"" with ""durability"" when talking about Volvos. They are the latter.",5.0,"Great Alternative Sports Sedan!

I bought it because my other half fell in love with it and at the time I couldn't say no. Boy was I fool for that. This is the most boring car i've ever owned!!! I bought the car as a certified pre-owned and it had all the options, which was great, but all that didn't matter once I started having to drive it on a regular basis. The ride is somewhat smooth but you definitely don't feel like you are connected to the road when driving it. I got rid of my E46 BMW 325Ci w/sport package and OMG how I regret it!I am now driving the C70 as my daily driver and I absolutely HATE this car! It handles like runny dog crap! Way too much body roll and clumsy handling, it does not corner well at all, and good luck if you need to do a u-turn. The turning radius is TERRIBLE, don't expect to do a quick U-turn in this car, instead be prepared to do a three point turn every single time, which is absolutely PATHETIC! I have started calling this the Volvo Town Car because it handles like a granny-mobile even though it is a small car.The acceleration is sad and even with the Dealer optimized Polestar upgrade, which costs $1k dollars, it still lacks any real oomph other than making the tires chirp a little if you take off abruptly.The transmission is garbage and does not change gears appropriately for the situation at hand. It upshifts way too quickly even when you are trying to accelerate and get into freeway traffic. I tried using the manual mode a few times and found it utterly useless and very backwards compared to any other european automobile I have driven. At steady cruising speeds on the highway it gets craptastic fuel economy, averaging about 22MPG and even worse with inner city driving (16mpg at best). The suspension is vile, you end up feeling every single damn bump in the road as if you were driving a go-kart. Also the car rattles like crazy when you hit a bump, which is a sure sign of crappy build quality, my 10 year old BMW never suffered such rattles. Visibility is total s*** due to the horrible placement of the rearview mirror and the door panels which come up to my shoulder. I'm 6'3"" if I move the seat up from the lowest position my head rubs the roof, which also leads to my next complaint. When putting the top up in this car I have had my head smashed twice. If you are a taller person you have to move your head slightly to the right, otherwise the roof line pillar in the top will come down on your head relatively hard when closing.The only positive about this car is the upgraded factory sound system and the front seats are super comfy. The dials are pretty simple and the menu interface is great, but that is the only thing I will say that is nice about this horrible handling beast. The repair costs and amount of things that have gone wrong on this car are unforgivable and expensive to repair. The car has stalled out on me numerous times and when it is brought into the dealership they can't diagnose or duplicate the problem, the top has failed to close properly about 5 times now and even with adjustments it sometimes fails to latch properly. Water has been leaking in where the tops meets the windshield, even when it IS completely latched, and we can't seem to locate where it is coming in. I cannot wait to trade this POS in for a new BMW convertible. I've never had the lack of confidence and fear of a car breaking down as I have with this heap of trash and I have owned Jaguars, BMWs, and even an 05 Ford Mustang.

Has all the power I need in town and on the highway. Love it! Love it! Update after 7 months of ownership: Love the flexibility of a true car with convertible option depending on weather or travel plans. Car has been wonderful with no issues!

At 60,000 miles, have dealer replace both rubber axle booth - under dealer warranty.  At 70,000 miles, have dealer replaced the leaky coolant reservoir - under dealer warranty.  Other than these, no issue with the car for past 4 years.  C70 is very stylish and many people compliment the car.  One time I was approached by a lady on a red light - thought I was being carjacked, but she wanted to know what car I was driving.  Seats are very comfy and I feel like sitting in comfy sofa at Ikea store.  C70 came with one of the best stereo I ever witnessed. My previous Infiniti Q45 Bose system is sub-par to C70's.   The stereo sound great even with top down.  Bluetooth, however, need improvement.  Bluetooth phone Volume is very low (I have Samsung Note 4).   It has no A2DP option (for 2009 model) and when I asked around online, Bluetooth audio option is not available.   I use small thumb drive to play all my music.  It even taking 128gb thumb drive- thousands of songs!   Or you have option to plug in 3.5 jack via Aux.     There is no way you can install custom radio (not that I need one) since factory stereo also works as climate control display.    It's so much fund to drive during the California winter with top down (heated seat).  Top down during hot summer really make you enjoy the sun, but when I was driving Mojave and Las Vegas under 114 degree hot sun, I thought I was going to be roasted alive...        When top is up, I can hear some squeaky noise time to time, but if you don't pay attention, you can hardly hear them.  As with all front drive car, it has torque steering, but I have not experienced any under/over steering when cornering.    Break is bit soft compared to my wife's Toyota Sienna, but never failed the stopping distance as of now (I commute 60 miles on S. Calif 405 everyday, and I see accidents at least 4x a week).

Along with Volvos we have owned everything from Mini Vans to Mercedes, approximately 55 vehicles in all.I was attracted to the V70 because of styling, performance and the need for cargo space. All of which have been fulfilled with this car. We found this previously owned with 48,000 gentle one owner mi. and all service records up to date. We have taken several road trips thus far and use as a commuter during the week. Absolutely no disappointments at all and I enjoy driving a vehicle that doesnât  look like the majority of vehicles on the road.

 on 09/18/15 12:24 PM (PDT),edanstrekal@live.com ,2000 Volvo V70 Wagon 4dr Wagon,Best money I ever spent on a used car--still!," I've owned quite a few used cars.  I was always attracted to unique or freaky cars--old Volkswagens, Cadillacs, 1980s Audis, and more recently Saabs.  I always wanted a Volvo wagon because I thought they looked cool and I'd heard good things about reliability of the 2.4L five cylinder engine.  I was a little hesitant about the electrical system as it seems all European vehicles have electrical issues, some more so than others.  With that being said, this is by far one of the finest vehicles I have ever owned (and I only paid $2500)!  I bought it from the second owner with around 178K miles on it.  The former owner provided me with all the maintenance records from the time it was new.  In the last couple of years, he himself had addressed many of the preventative maintenance issues including timing belt, brakes, shocks, and radiator.  The only issues were the lock on the tailgate doesn't work with the central locking system and there is a bulb burned out behind the odometer.  Since I've owned it, I've just kept the oil changed, tires rotated, and replaced the plugs and air filter when necessary.  I've had a few issues with the check engine light coming on now and then, but I've just cleaned the MAF and throttle body thoroughly and that seems to have fixed it now for over  a year and a half!  It passes smog with flying colors.  Update: I did recently replace the upper o2 sensor on account of the CEL not turning off.  I unfortunately broke a few vacuum lines in the process, but everything is okay!  CEL went off and the car is again running like a top.The wagon is very utilitarian.  I can carry all kinds of things in the back, bikes, dressers, tables, almost anything within reason.  More recently I've been using the car to haul stuff for the events business my wife works for.  I haul all kinds of flowers, chairs, linens, etc up to Lake Tahoe without problems.  The heating and cooling are much better than expected (the A/C is great actually), and the acceleration for being a non-turbo isn't half bad.  It's not a hot rod, but it has the power to go up and down over the Sierra Nevada mountains, which I often do on my way to Sacramento.  The seats are some of the most comfortable I've ever experienced (I just wish mine had the heated leather).  It is always nice returning to my Volvo after having a rental car.  As far as gas mileage is concerned I average about 23.3 around town, and on long trips I can usually manage over 30.  That's not half bad for a car this size and weight.  Although it rattles, and it isn't the smoothest ride, it handles well, always starts up, and just keeps on going at even with 201,000 miles.  It doesn't burn any oil and everything functions as it should, sans the tailgate lock.  A great bang for your buck, and since it's old I really don't care what happens to it.  I think this car has sold me on buying another Volvo in the future.Update:I parted ways with my V70 last weekend.  I bought a slightly newer S60 with AWD.  I am really hoping for the same reliability as the old wagon, but only time will tell.  It had about 204,000 with no signs of slowing down anytime soon.  The new owner was hard-pressed to find any real issues with the thing.  I sold it to him for $1000, and I think it was a great deal.  One thing is for sure, I'll never forget the joy and piece of mind this car brought me during ownership.",5.0,"Best money I ever spent on a used car--still! I've owned quite a few used cars.

Granted, a car this old will have some Turbo Lag for sure, but a 1983 Porsche 911 Turbo also spools up a bit slowly. Mileage isn't outstanding around town or highway compared to new cars. Thing is, it's comfortable and can haul your stuff. I love this low roofed 2 box design. The different front Fascia w/ fog lights, wheels, rear air deflector etc make it the best looking Volvo wagon. I added the factory twin or dual exhaust which the 1999 didn't come with. I tinted the windows, dark in the back, legal on front windows. I also added IPD super headlights, which work better and look real cool. The mids, tweets and subs add up to the best, most balanced stereo I've had. Some things aren't ideal...costs a lot to service...I was spending $1000/yr average for service when driving a lot. Now I'm retired. Mine is different than some I've ridden in...it is quiet w/o creaks, groans and rattles (which drive me crazy). The interior is in good shape w/o tears etc. The defroster could work better. Uses about a quart (one of 6 quarts/oil change) every 3000 miles which is more than acceptable. I have used full synthetic oil since I bought it 50,000 miles ago, changing it every 3-5000 miles.

 on 06/08/18 16:44 PM (PDT),Chris ,1999 Volvo V70 Wagon 4dr Wagon,An excellent used car buy," I bought my '99 V70 Base Wagon with about 160,000 miles on it, including all the maintenance and repair receipts since it was new. It now has about 214,000 miles. It still has the original muffler and exhaust system, starter, alternator, radiator and clutch. The A/C works great and has never been recharged. Most cars would have had all of those replaced by now. The engine and transmission have been rock solid. (The manual transmissions will last forever - the automatics, not so much.) The engine holds 5 quarts, instead of 4 like most smaller engines. It's never used more than a quart in 5000 miles. Mileage has been between 20 and 25 around town, and about 30 on long trips. The 5-banger has plenty of power - any more, and I'd be getting speeding tickets. I have used the V70 to tow numerous cars on a dolly, including other V70s! The seats are the most comfortable I've ever sat in, and the visibility is terrific. Maintenance, while I have had it: The wiring harness to the back hatch - it flexes when it's opened and closed, and had several broken wires when I bought the car. The brake pads are finally getting down, after 50K or more miles. The driver's seat vinyl is finally starting to crack. Not bad for 19 years old.  The oil filter will pour oil on your hand when you take it off, every time. Use a disposable glove. The radiator shroud is made of fiberglass, and it gives me an itchy rash if I ever rest my arm on it. The biggest complaint that I have is the squeaking dash, which is worse when it's cold. There is one mounting point that tends to break after a few years. It's a common characteristic of this model. It can be repaired (if you are a bit daring and handy) by a bolt through the firewall. This is a great used car, especially if you like to fix the little things (like light bulbs and brake pads) every now and then. Those little characteristics just give it character and personality. I've had lots of cars over the last 34 years, and the V70 is certainly one of my favorites. It's very dependable, roomy without being oversized, is almost as useful as a pickup, had decent economy, is fun to drive and is a classic, instead of trying to be trendy. It finds the middle ground between luxury, economy and practicality without giving up anything for safety.

My husband had a 940 T wagon and it was awesome.  So we bought this wagon used in 2009.  It has been a great car up until 2016.   It started off with a code P4099 which we could not find.   Then the handle on the gear shifter when you depress it, it stays depressed which makes it easy to pop out of gear and then when you put it in park, you cant get your key out of the ignition until you get the shift handle to un-depress.   Have to use the shift override button every time I take it out of park.   Most annoying.   To the left of the shifter is the readout for what gear your in, the plastic piece that fits in that area keeps moving and I cant tell what gear I am in.  Had my brakes replaced and new rotors and they still squeal when depressed especially when going in reverse.  Every so often the car shudders and acts like it is going to die.  In fact this year 2017 just this week it died on me in traffic at a red light and I had a hard time getting it started. The car doesn't rev high when first started, but to me it idles high,  the engine sounds loud unless I put it in neutral.   4 years ago the outside clear coat started peeling off.  Looks terrible.

Over 3 years left on original warranty plus Volvo adds a 3 year certification. BMW, Audi, etc. add 2 years for CPO & Mercedes only 1.  I like the styling much more than the former Volvo wagons that looked like refrigerators on wheels.  This is a sleek modern looking vehicle. Like a maxi version on the former cute little C70 which I liked as much as Mini's if not more. Like most al wheel drive cars the mileage isn't great in the city. He just enough pep, but no faster than our former Outback 3.6R. However the Outback had no sport mode to add pep when passing or accelerating. It's smaller than the Outback which I like for city parking. Rear space is small for a wagon, but with rear seats folded down there is plenty of room. It held five tires easily when I changes tires from all the Scorpion all-seasons. I run summer and winter tires always. The brakes are a weak point. Much longer stopping distance than a car at this price should require. Being bought for safety it's disappointing and needs a fix. The better tires help a bit. I like the keyless entry and the auto folding side mirrors which fold when you lock the car for parking. The rear windows inhibit viability, but that's the design. Our other option to the Outback was the Audi Cross Country. The option was too expensive and not a faster car. The Volvo parts are outrageous! I wanted a set of wheels for winter snow tires, but they were $500/each. If one of the OEM wheels has to be replaced that's the cost. The Tire Rack doesn't have this cars fitment yet so until they get one to spec out I can't buy winter tires. I suspect that this is not a big a seller as the FWD V60 which is less expensive and lower. We needed the Cross Country for it's height for snow clearance. We get too much! I blast our wagons out of the long driveway rather than shovel. My Audi S5 doesn't have much clearance though AWD. I prefer not to use it in heavy snow though I run high performance winter tires (Dunlap winter sports) in one size down from the OEM 19s. I plan to buy W80s or Xice3's for the Volvo once I find reasonably priced wheels. No way I'm buying Volvo wheels at their pricing.I bought W80s for snow and ice. Haven't had any bad weather to try them out. Rides well on these tires. Found really nice wheels from the tire rack. The electronics are limited to use with an AT&T mobile device (only) which is ridiculous. I use Verizon, so I can't use many features. Very sore point. On the positive side I stumbled onto a power mode feature that the dealership was not even aware of on this wagon. Rather than being part of the features you choose on the center console, it is on the turn signal! You choose power mode (1 of 3 choices) and put the shifter in sport mode and the car changes character from a slug to a car with zip. Now it stays in power mode!!

 on 04/19/17 16:19 PM (PDT),first477 ,2000 Volvo S70 Sedan 4dr Sedan,Last of great Volvos," Overall this is a great car. I have the non turbo 5 speed automatic and I bought it used with 120,xxx miles. It now has 124,xxx. When I bought the car, I thought I was getting a stupid good deal, but as I owned it longer I realized why it was so dirt cheap. This is the kind of car you definitely to take good care of or else it will not take care of you. You really have to stay on top of the timing belt, oil changes, trans fluid, thermostat, etc, or else you have nightmares down the line. If you buy a turbo model, you definitely need to pay attention to how you drive the car to keep the turbo well maintained (drive it slow when its cold, let it run 30-60 seconds before and after shutoff/startup, etc). There are a number of things that can go wrong with the car that you have to be aware of. First is the heater core. If it fails, you're gonna lose of lot of coolant, fast, so watch your temp gauge and if it starts getting too hot, pull over and get it fixed so you don't blow your head gasket. Next is the Positive Crankcase Ventilation System. With age and mileage, it gets clogged up and it needs to be serviced. It's gonna set you back at least $300 if you do it yourself and you have all the tools you need, but it's upwards of $600-700 if you get an independent shop to do it. If you opt not to do it, and it needed to be done, you risk blowing either a crankshaft seal or a rear main seal, either of which means your car is basically totaled. If you change the oil often enough, you should be able to go a good long while before it needs to be serviced. If you find a car and you can't get documentation of recent repairs for the PCV system, timing belt, or heater core, you will need to have those serviced otherwise you'll be losing a lot of money when your car breaks. Also of importance, these transmissions are claimed to use a lifetime fluid, which is definitely not true. The fluid needs to be changed at least every 70,000 miles. The 2000 models without the turbo have an extremely sensitive Aisin Warner 5 speed automatic, and it definitely needs the fluid changed often. Its pretty easy to do to. The 4 speed automatics on the turbo models are a lot less sensitive but you still need to change the fluid often enough. Also, the suspensions in these cars wear out, so expect repairs around the 150-200 thousand mile mark. A very major problem with these cars that most people notice and are turned off right away is the squeaky dashboard. Yes, it squeaks like no other car I've ever been in. It's very unsettling, but it doesn't effect the drivability of the car and frankly I got used it in one week of driving it. There are fixes for it, but they're personally not worth the effort. Other little things are probably going to break on the car too. The overall build quality is not that good to be honest. If taken care of, it will serve as a wonderful, stylish point A to B car. /// How does the car drive? It's very comfortable and relaxing to drive. The seats are classic Volvo, very comfortable. The brake pedal has a good feel and it stops well. The gas pedal is touchy in the first 5-10% of the travel, but other than that, its a very good gas pedal. The steering is excellent overall. The weight is good, not terribly light but not heavy. It tries to turn all the way to one side when turned far, but it tracks straight well at smaller turn angles. As an added bonus, the turn radius is actually pretty tight. Handling is a little on the soft side, and you can tell it doesn't like to be driven fast in twists or corners. Acceleration is pretty average for a car of this size. The 5 cylinder engine sounds fantastic. Just go on youtube and watch some acceleration videos of s70s, 850s, etc, you'll see what I mean. Cruising rpm is a little high for my taste. Multiply the speed by 35 and that's the rpm in 5th gear. I personally think it could be lower. It's pretty quiet on the highway except for the squeaking. I drive very conservatively and I get about 24-26 mpg average. That's about 20% highway 80% city. I really like the styling of the car too. Inside and out looks gorgeous.

Since many of the reviews here are several years old, I thought I'd offer my two cents for anyone who is considering buying one of these OBGs (oldies but goodies).  This v70 SE had about 85k miles on it when I purchased it.  Today (10 years later), it has 216k.  I love, love, love this car!  If you can find one in decent condition, buy it!!  It has been a wonderful vehicle.  Very reliable, safe, comfortable.  Plenty of room in both the front and back seats, and generous trunk space.  (It may not seem like enough to you if you're used to a wagon or SUV, but it is a great-sized trunk for a sedan.)  Have taken several looong roadtrips (3k+ mi.) with this car, and can say that it's been fabulous!  Smooth, great acceleration whenever needed/wanted, and after 8-10 hours in the car during a long leg of the trip, you can emerge unscathed.  Super comfortable seating.  Even after 17 years, I average 25.5 mpg, comprised mostly of in-town driving and some highway.  Great steering, suspension.  The idea of having to part with it at some point down the road makes me sad.  I spend approx. $1k/year on repairs and maintenance (normal service, tires, repairs, everything).  That amount would make me bleed from the eyes if the car was new, but this vehicle is mature, and some amount of replacement must be expected.

 on 12/15/13 21:02 PM (PST),cjbluedevil06 ,2006 Volvo XC90 SUV 2.5T 4dr SUV (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),Excellent Used Car Value ," I purchased my XC90 2.5T in March of 2013 with 74K miles. It is the third Volvo that I have owned and is by far my favorite. I traded in my 2004 S60 to buy the XC90. Many people say that the 2.5T engine is underpowered, but I feel that its 208hp feels peppy and is perfectly matched to the transmission. The handling feels confident and the seats are very comfortable. As far as cargo spaces is concerned, I am pleased.Fuel economy is decent for a vehicle of its size. I average about 17 in town and 23-24 on the highway. The cabin is quiet and the interior is composed of high quality materials. My vehicle has the optional navigation system, which is nice, but inputting information can be an annoyance.Update** It is now three years later and I will say that buying a used XC90 was a great decision.  I now have 111K miles on my XC90 and I have been impressed with the reliability of the vehicle.  I recently visited the Volvo dealership for regular scheduled maintenance (replacement of the timing belt and drive belt) and spent about $750 for that service.  When the dealership completed the maintenance inspection during the visit, they were unable to find anything that needed to be replaced or repaired. They key to buying a used Volvo is to ensure you buy it from a Volvo dealer and research the maintenance history of the vehicle. Aside from buying tires and having oil changes, the most I have spent on the vehicle has been for the timing and drive belt service. I have not had a single issue. It is my hope that I am able to put 200,000 miles on my XC90.  Once I am done with this one, I do plan on buying another XC90 or an XC60. When it comes to safety, reliability, and quality, I find it hard to beat. It is an excellent road trip vehicle and is the perfect size to accommodate passengers and cargo. I do wish the fuel economy was a little better, but I do have to keep in mind that for a 2006, it falls in the more fuel efficient range of most SUV's for that time.  As a final note, if you are looking for a used XC90 for whatever reason, it is best to stay away from the T6 (2.9 liter I-6 cylinder turbo engine) variants made from 2003-2005 and the V8 engines.  The 2.5T's (I-5 cylinder turbo engines) were discontinued in 2006 and did not suffer from the transmission issues of the T6 and V8 engines.

Now at 133k the car is going strong with the exception of major service.  The transmission irregularities previously mentioned, while not severe, were increasing in frequency and ultimately diagnosed as a faulty speed sensor.  One of four was failing causing the issues that would eventually kill the tranny.  Correcting this, along with a number of other more minor leaks was a $5k service.  I ultimately decided to proceed despite the cost being roughly equal to the cars value because the rest of the car was in good working order.  With 3 young kids, we're tough an our cars and I was not interested in buying a new one only to have it beaten and battered by kids, crumbs and crayons.  The procedure was a total success and I'm very please to have spent the money.  I'm now expecting to drive this for another 2 -3 years and should reasonably expect to get close to 200k miles without issue.  This car is a work horse and, if treated properly performs very well.  The finishes don't withstand the test of time like other european luxury cars but it's a really just a fancy Ford after all.  Great family car.  If buying a high milage XC90 you should expect to put some money into it over the years but I think that's true of most.  I still recommend the early model XC90's from 2007 - 2010.  (Avoid 2006 - many issues).    -----------------------------This is a really great SUV.  Classic Styling, spacious and well appointed interior and just the right amount of prestige.  And then you look more closely.  I just got done telling my wife that it's been a good car for us.  10 years and 122,000 miles without any real problems.  I mean, the transmission has done mildly sporadic shifting a couple dozen time throughout owning the car but we're one of the lucky few who's transmission hasn't failed them (do lots of research on the transmissions around 2004-2007).  We've been diligent about regular scheduled service (which is not inexpensive at all) but have not had any major surprises or mechanical issues.  Still, It looks great, has a ton of conveniences and is very comfortable.In the end, it's a small taste of luxury but upon closer look it's built with lower quality parts that scratch, break or rattle more than they should.  It drives as though it's twice the size and twice the [already heavy] weight.  Pot holes are jarring and it eats through tires (AWD) and brakes faster than my 5 yr. old crushes a juice box.  Also expect bushings to go faster than smaller/lighter cars.  Still, 10 years later, my car's a little rough around the edges with dings, scratches and small tears in the leather even but it's 10 years old and has reliably seen me through a puppy and two children.  The third row is still best in class and the cargo space incredible.  I just did the 120k service which ended up costing north of $2k because I also needed brakes and tires.  I expect to put an average of $1k a year into maintenance and expect to get another 60k miles without issue.  My neighborhood is crawling with high-milage xc90s and when treated well, they still look and drive wonderfully.  Would I buy this car again?  Absolutely.

 on 01/09/18 09:07 AM (PST),Paul ,2018 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Inscription 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),XC90 Beats the competitors," Continued review after 10 months of ownership:   All initial comments still hold true.  Not mentioned earlier was the standard stereo system with 300 watts.  I found the system to be excellent and personally, if your not an audiophile, buying the B&W system to me would be a waste of money.  While the ride on the 21"" wheels is excellent I would opt for the air suspension system for an even more comfortable ride. 2 months ago I opted to install the Polestar ECU upgrade.  What a positive change in performance and it also seems to help with even better and smoother transmission shifts.  It was a little expensive paying $50.00 per 1 horsepower gained  (30 horsepower total) but I really enjoy the performance difference.  I don't know if it is the Polestar upgrade or breaking in of the engine but I have gained about 1 mpg on average. My next XC90 will most certainly be a T8.  I do quite a bit of driving in town and probably would never exceed the 19-20 mile electric capability and I suspect in the upcoming 2021-2022 make over Volvo will increase the KwH capacity providing for more miles between charges.I, like many other owners of Volvo's have owned other premium vehicles and most certainly cross shopped for the best value, durability and drive-ability before purchasing a Volvo.  Having owned MB, Lexus and other vehicles I have always had a Volvo in the garage.  This is my 13th and can honestly say that for all but 1 have earned my appreciation for durable vehicles.  I have driven this XC90 for 6,000 miles both in good weather and bad and an equal amount of time in town driving and on the interstate.  The following are my thoughts and pros and cons: PROS - 1) excellent drive-line (don't worry about this SUV only having a supercharged/turbocharged 4 cylinder motor.  It is equal to or better than competitors 4 cylinder and some V6 motors ).  Very strong engine with plenty of on ramp and passing power.  Fairly quite even under hard acceleration. Shifts are smooth and it is hard to tell when the transmission is shifting.  I found the car to be very well damped and smooth even though I have the optional 21 inch wheels.  2) MPG is as advertised so their were no surprises there. 3) ergonomics are in a class by themselves as Volvo has always been known for their comfortable seating and the XC 90 does not disappoint.  Anyone owning German autos will know what I'm talking about because seats in MBs and BMWs are like sitting on concrete and become uncomfortable after a couple of hours.  Audi seats are a little more forgiving but not by much.  The closest comfortable seat to a Volvo is Lexus.   All controls fall easily to hand in the XC90.  Second row seating is comfortable with the seat backs ability to recline, plenty of knee room and the foot-wells are large enough for folks wearing bulky shoes or boots.  Third row seating is easily accessed but not much room for adults.  4) Infotainment - I found the SENSUS system to be intuitive and easy to use.  Take the time to spend a couple of hours learning the system and you won't be disappointed in what is offered in the way of information, audio, wi-fi, climate control (all three sections) navi, forward and backup camera's etc.  4) Lighting -  I really enjoy the LED headlights (swiveling) and fog lights angles.  The fog lights illuminate to each side of the vehicle extremely well.  The interior lighting is fantastic and I like the ability to change the colors as well as the strength of the lights.  Back up lighting is superb. 5) Maintenance - It is great to have service covered vs paying huge maintenance fees.  I have had the car back to the service dept one time for a software upgrade but other than that the SUV has been bullet proof.  No rattles, squeaks or groans in the cabin. No problems with SENSUS.   I call the cabin the ""cone of silence"".  CONS - 1) SENSUS -  sometimes can be slow to process upon initial start up.  It can take up to 10 seconds for the software to wake up and all applications to activate.  I wish the backup camera was not part of the infotainment system.  Volvo would be wise to separate the camera from the rest of SENSUS.  A minor irritant, but one nevertheless.  2)  We like that there is wi-fi connectivity but set up through AT&T was not an easy on-line process.  I ended up spending an hour or more via phone with a AT&T representative to get connected. Not much more to report at this time.  Sounds like I'm writing an ad for Volvo with so few CONs but truly for me this SUV is a delight to drive with no bad surprises.  Most certainly the best built Volvo I have owned.

 on 11/07/17 17:00 PM (PST),Andy ,2018 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 R-Design 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),"Best SUV, most awarded large SUV for a reason"," On top of reviewing the car itself, I will also provide quick a review on the brand's Oversea Delivery program (OSD).  First, about the vehicle itself, one of the best 7-seater SUVs on the market.  In its class, the only competitor is Audi Q7. And to configure the Audi Q7 with similar equipment including full digital dashboard, semi-autonomous pilot assist feature, upgraded interior and sound systems, heads up display and others, the Q7 will run at least $5-8K more.  So in terms of value alone, XC90 is a more sensible selection.  I realize that even with the XC90 and in the R-Design trim that I have, it costs more than $71K out-the-door, so to some shoppers the value isn't the most important aspect of the decision making process. Then let's take a look at the various tangible advantages that XC90 offers aside from pricing.  First and foremost, the interior of the XC90 is in a class of its own.  The upgraded contour seats are just amazing.  It truly provides the best comfort in any car money can buy. Next, the center console design is fantastic with the large touchscreen interface. The only thing that can compare to it is the even larger and better panel in the Tesla Model X.  Some reviewers on youtube still prefer the button and joystick controls in the Q7 or X5, but I think it is just the matter of accepting a change.  After using the XC90 touchscreen interface for about a week, I found it very intuitive and it responds very quickly.  I don't understand some of the comments which claim that using touchscreen during driving is more distracting. The fact is, no matter which systems you use, the driver still has to scroll through numerous menus either with a mouse pad (ie: Lexus) or a i-drive type joystick (ie: Audi/BMW), and they are all distracting. I found that the touchscreen on the XC90 at least offers huge icon for most features and all you need to do is to swipe left and right between two large menus.  To me, it really cannot get any simpler after one week of getting familiarizing of the system. By contrast, I found the concept of a retractable infotainment screen in the Q7 is very out of date. A retractable screen like that has been a thing in the past since the late-2000 Cadillac CTS.   The final point about XC90 interior is the fit and finish. Every single piece of the interior materials is top notch and the simplistic Scandinavian design is great.  However, the cabin is not the most quiet for a car in this price range. It is definitely not as tranquil as the cabin of a Mercedes.   Now, the second part of the review is about the OSD program. I did it when I placed the order with Volvo. With the OSD, there is no negotiation on prices, everything is ordered per the price list. The listed prices for the car and options are only slightly, if any, lower than MSRP.  The kicker is that OSD waives the destination charge, which saves $995 automatically.  In addition to that, Volvo provides 2 round trip tickets from any where in the USA to Gothenborg, Sweden and a night of hotel for you to travel to the factory and pick up your own car.  You may drive your own car through Europe up to 6 months and Volvo even covers the cost of your insurance up for 15 days.  And when you're done with the self-driving tour, you return the car to one of the designated locations and they will ship the car to your local dealership in the USA with no additional shipping charge.  So buying a car and getting a free trip to Sweden, why not?  I particular like this shopping experience because there is no haggling. I know what I am going to order and how much I'm going to pay exactly.  I get to tour the Volvo factory and drive my own car to see a part of Europe where I don't visit very often.  Such a great way to buy a car.",5.0,"Best SUV, most awarded large SUV for a reason On top of reviewing the car itself, I will also provide quick a review on the brand's Oversea Delivery program (OSD).

I realize that even with the XC90 and in the R-Design trim that I have, it costs more than $71K out-the-door, so to some shoppers the value isn't the most important aspect of the decision making process. Then let's take a look at the various tangible advantages that XC90 offers aside from pricing.  First and foremost, the interior of the XC90 is in a class of its own.  The upgraded contour seats are just amazing.  It truly provides the best comfort in any car money can buy. Next, the center console design is fantastic with the large touchscreen interface. The only thing that can compare to it is the even larger and better panel in the Tesla Model X.  Some reviewers on youtube still prefer the button and joystick controls in the Q7 or X5, but I think it is just the matter of accepting a change.  After using the XC90 touchscreen interface for about a week, I found it very intuitive and it responds very quickly.  I don't understand some of the comments which claim that using touchscreen during driving is more distracting. The fact is, no matter which systems you use, the driver still has to scroll through numerous menus either with a mouse pad (ie: Lexus) or a i-drive type joystick (ie: Audi/BMW), and they are all distracting. I found that the touchscreen on the XC90 at least offers huge icon for most features and all you need to do is to swipe left and right between two large menus.  To me, it really cannot get any simpler after one week of getting familiarizing of the system. By contrast, I found the concept of a retractable infotainment screen in the Q7 is very out of date. A retractable screen like that has been a thing in the past since the late-2000 Cadillac CTS.   The final point about XC90 interior is the fit and finish. Every single piece of the interior materials is top notch and the simplistic Scandinavian design is great.  However, the cabin is not the most quiet for a car in this price range. It is definitely not as tranquil as the cabin of a Mercedes.   Now, the second part of the review is about the OSD program. I did it when I placed the order with Volvo. With the OSD, there is no negotiation on prices, everything is ordered per the price list. The listed prices for the car and options are only slightly, if any, lower than MSRP.  The kicker is that OSD waives the destination charge, which saves $995 automatically.  In addition to that, Volvo provides 2 round trip tickets from any where in the USA to Gothenborg, Sweden and a night of hotel for you to travel to the factory and pick up your own car.  You may drive your own car through Europe up to 6 months and Volvo even covers the cost of your insurance up for 15 days.  And when you're done with the self-driving tour, you return the car to one of the designated locations and they will ship the car to your local dealership in the USA with no additional shipping charge.  So buying a car and getting a free trip to Sweden, why not?  I particular like this shopping experience because there is no haggling. I know what I am going to order and how much I'm going to pay exactly.  I get to tour the Volvo factory and drive my own car to see a part of Europe where I don't visit very often.  Such a great way to buy a car.","[('price list', 'list'), ('destination charge', 'charge')]","['only competitor', 'only thing', 'huge icon', 'large menus', 'pay exactly', 'most features', 'saves automatically', 'even larger panel', 'larger panel']","[['car'], ['vehicle', 'one'], ['nt'], ['one'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'take'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['car', 'one'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'think'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['drive'], ['one'], ['nt'], ['like'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'great'], ['car', 'range'], ['second'], ['car'], ['car'], ['drive', 'nt', 'car'], ['car', 'one'], ['like', 'car'], ['drive', 'car'], ['car', 'great']]","[('Delivery program', 'program'), ('seater SUVs', 'SUVs'), ('pilot assist', 'assist'), ('assist feature', 'feature'), ('Design trim', 'trim'), ('car money', 'money'), ('center design', 'design'), ('console design', 'design'), ('touchscreen interface', 'interface'), ('mouse pad', 'pad'), ('drive joystick', 'joystick'), ('type joystick', 'joystick'), ('price range', 'range'), ('OSD program', 'program'), ('trip tickets', 'tickets'), ('self driving', 'driving'), ('driving tour', 'tour'), ('shipping charge', 'charge'), ('shopping experience', 'experience'), ('Volvo factory', 'factory')]","['truly provides', 'autonomous assist feature', 'free trip', 'touchscreen touchscreen interface', 'best comfort', 'simplistic center console design', 'responds quickly', 'similar equipment', 'full dashboard', 'retractable screen', 'local dealership', 'interior materials', 'important aspect', 'top notch', 'most important aspect', 'more sensible selection', 'interior systems', 'offers aside', 'round trip tickets', 'visit often', 'even covers', 'large touchscreen interface', 'numerous menus', 'final point', 'most awarded', 'more distracting', 'great way', 'additional shipping charge', 'sensible selection', 'best seater SUVs', 'large SUV', 'single piece', 'Then let', 'still prefer', 'condriving tour seats', 'Scandinavian center console design', 'digital dashboard', 'infotainment screen', 'So buying', 'various advantages', 'own car', 'still scroll', 'tangible advantages', 'semi assist feature', 'second part']",pos

Very happy with purchase after 2,200 miles and 8 weeks. Wrestled with decision - final competitor was the Q-7. Volvo won my business based upon the features offered, safety rating, outstanding active bending LED high beam headlights and PRICE! Q-7 was/is a fantastic vehicle - but feature for feature the Q-7 is just more expensive and I couldn't justify the additional cost of $3,000 to $5,000. On top of this good pricing we got an additional $3,000 Conquest Award due to owning a Mercedes Benz! I liked that the Volvo has a spare tire in it vs. run flats on the Q-7. The park assist on the Volvo (parallel & perpendicular) is something that Audi didn't offer. Huge sunroof in the Volvo came in the Momentum but was an upcharge in the Q-7. Styling (inside and out) of the XC90 is very striking (in a positive way). Decent base sound system. Seats - very comfortable ... and I like the seating position as well ... good visibility. 2nd row seating is generous and comfortable with plenty of room for big feet. The 3rd row is handy - certainly not something for full-size adults for anything longer than a local trip - but reasonably comfortable for smaller adults and the younger generation. Good overall cargo capacity. Comes with roof rack too. The trailer hitch is cleverly concealed to give the rear of the vehicle a nice finished look. We have the 21"" wheels with Pirelli tires - and while the ride is no doubt a little stiffer - I don't find it objectionable - I like the looks of the larger wheel.   The 4 cylinder definitely has 6 cylinder performance - and inside the vehicle it also sounds like a 6 to me - not sure if Volvo has intervened to make the engine sound more robust when inside the cabin. Outside it sounds like a 4. My wife was able to lock her key in the car - something that shouldn't be able to occur. You'll need to devote some time to read the manual to learn all features of the electronics and safely features - but it's well worth the time spent. Needs more USB ports. Could use a sunglass holder in the overhead area. Only time will tell regarding quality.  Overall both my wife and I are pleased with the XC90.

So far so good, but fingers crossed. My initial reaction as a former diehard Grand Cherokee owner (5 in a row) is that a I am very happy with my purchase. The looks of the XC90 really caught my eye, but the interior quality sealed the deal for me. I had reservations about the 4 cylinder, but a test drive alleviated my concerns that it would b sufficient for th size. While it is by no means going to be mistaken for an 8 cylinder, I am impressed by the 316hp output especially at highway speeds and would describe the output as a solid v6 caliber. My Summer daily driver is a Z06 Corvette so, the road noise, and ride comfort are fine for my tastes. I sincerely wrestled with the idea of owning a Volvo, but the exterior looks and interior quality rival other luxury SUVs going for 10's of thousands more. I wanted a car with better fit and finish, more 2nd row legroom, roof rack and the third row was a bonus. I looked at the Cayenne and Q7. Performance wise, the XC90 is subpar, but for the money I could not beat everything this had to offer. The dash tech is fantastic and I'm just starting to get to know the lane assist, adaptive cruise, and pilot assist features, and they are impressive. While the 316hp output is impressive, the 4 cylinder is a bit ""tinny"" sounding...with an almost Diesel engine exhaust note. The base suspension is a tad rough, and the cockpit is not what I would call quiet. Road and engine noise does come through. Again, with all that I'm very pleased in large part to the deal I got. I had the benefit of getting $2500 Volvo ""conquest"" cash and $750 from Costco, on top of an insanely good trade in value on my Jeep (month end, slow night). I parted with a v8, adjustable ride height, quieter cockpit and I'd argue smoother ride, but gained increased driver / passenger space, better interior quality, stunning exterior, smooth tech interface, 4 years of VolvoOncall (Onstar like), increased safety features and amenities. I'm looking forward to a road trip to get to know it a little better.

 on 01/08/18 08:42 AM (PST),Ryan Taylor ,2018 Volvo XC90 Hybrid T8 Inscription Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger gas/electric hybrid 8A),Unexpectedly Exceptional," The luxury options on this vehicle place it among the top auto manufacturers. The interior design, and every element, has been so thoughtfully crafted around the driver, it is hard to believe that more people have not discovered Volvo. They really have stepped up to win with this one. The quality of materials would be on par with Bentley! I love the mix of leather, wood (with a matte finish), chrome dressings, all highlited with LED accents. Although the shiny black plastic area tend to collect fingerprints easily, which is why they supply a cleaning cloth (which you will use often). The seats are incredibly comfortable, with heat, cooling and a massage option that you will wonder how you ever lived without! Even the second row seats recline and are super comfy. The built-in child booster seat is convenient for when you have family or guests. The $3200 Bowers & Wilkins audio system is like being in a live concert, where, when you turn up the volume, you hear every detail in crisp clarity without it hurting your ears. If you love music, this could alone be reason enough to buy this SUV. I chose the hybrid option, which when you lease, you save the $5k California Rebate off the purchase price (as opposed to getting a tax credit when you purchase). I love that I can plug it in and get 15-18 miles of gas-free driving. It adds extra power that makes this 6600lb car move very fast. I also love that it drives completely silent on the Pure or hybrid mode. To me, this was worth the additional price. The instrument display is great and the main 9â Sensus central display is so easy to use and again, really thought through. It is so sensible and user friendly, I am very impressed. Apple CarPlay works great, as does the Bluetooth option. The XM radio is amazing and it has a Spotify app that uses the AT&T modem, if you sign up for data service. Iâm using the trial and have had a few issues with it buffering, as there is no option to download a playlist, like you can on a phone. I think that I will probably just use my iPhone with Spotify instead of paying for another device ($10/20 per mo). One last note, the safety features are the best available. I love the auto steering that helps you stay in your lane during normal everyday driving. It watches the road lines and applies corrective steering automatically if you start to drift. The heads up display is great too. It gives you a warning if you are driving too close, or if it senses a forward collision (which It sometimes falsely does on curvy roads). It displays the current speed limit and warns you if you drive faster (you can adjust the warning speed too). These features help you to be a better driver. Overall Iâm so impressed and happy with my purchase. I sold my Porsche 911s to buy this vehicle and I would never go back! I also, love that there are not tons of these cars on the road and when friends hear I bought a Volvo, they donât have any idea how amazing it is. Everyone already knows that Volvos are the safest cars in the world, they just donât expect them to be this exceptional.",5.0,"Unexpectedly Exceptional The luxury options on this vehicle place it among the top auto manufacturers.

 on 04/11/18 11:26 AM (PDT),Anthony ,2017 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Momentum 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),A Worthy SUV," I will start off by saying that I am a huge Volvo fan.  So when it came time to buy my new XC90 (T6 Momentum Plus), there wasn't much that was going to keep me from getting it.  Although, when I saw some of the reviews on here about software issues along with other ""nightmares"" resulting from new technology and bugs that weren't worked out.. I was a little apprehensive.  I decided to put my concerns to the side and take advantage of the year end close out deals and buy one.  I've been in the car for about 6 months now and have taken it all over Colorado and have been able to try it out in pretty much every driving scenario: traffic jams, countryside driving, mountain driving, rain, snow, icy conditions, etc.  After all of that I do have to say this car has been pretty much perfect.  My personal opinion is that other reviews about ""nightmares"" are not only exaggerated, but blown completely out of proportion.  This car's technology centers around safety, so if you're going to weave all over the road, drive it like a sports car, follow people too closely, or in other words drive like a moron.. this car is going to fight you (unless you disable the various safety systems) every step of the way.  I have slightly modified my driving style and find that all the technologies work as promised without any issues.  My first week of having the car I did have the auto brake engage when I was speeding up and getting too close to a car to change lanes but it didn't screech to a halt or anything like that.  It simply beeped at me and softly started to slow me down to avoid what it thought was an imminent crash.  It took me about a month to ""learn"" the car and adapt my driving accordingly.  Since that time everything has been smooth.  There are certain things that annoy me about the car that I do hope Volvo changes in the future, but they are minor issues.  For example, I love using the 360 degree camera as well as the parking features, but because I live in a busy city I don't have the time to stop in the middle of the road and swipe through 2-3 screens to select the feature i'm trying to use.  I wish they would add some shortcut buttons on the dash so I can quickly turn my 360 camera on/off or select a specific feature without having to swipe through a couple of menus first.  That part definitely gets old, but my overall enjoyment of the car as a whole outweighs those frustrations immensely.  It is extremely comfortable to drive, ride in, and it's a real head-turner to look at.  The gas mileage isn't bad, but I pretty much always keep the car in ECO mode unless i'm driving up into the mountains in which case I use Dynamic mode, and that makes the drive a real thrill.  I average between 19.5 and 21 MPG on a tank, and that is a mix of both city and highway driving.  When i'm going long distance on the interstate I average 23-26 MPG.  I do wish the fuel tank was a little larger, only getting 300 miles out of a tank before the gas light comes on means I have to get gas every single week.  Some of the other competing SUV's can get 400-600 miles out of a tank.",4.0,"A Worthy SUV I will start off by saying that I am a huge Volvo fan.

It looks, rides and performs (when it works) beautifully.   However, mine has been wrought with electrical/computer problems from the get/go.   It routinely spits out warning lights on various systems from ESC, engine, 12 volt system.   It has been in for repair (i.e not routine mtce) in one year more than my 2006 Mazda has been in its lifetime.   I am in my 60's and have owned many vehicles and this one has generated more warning lights in its short life than ALL my other vehicles combined.  Half the time software update is used by the dealer as the solution to my problems.   They almost never know what the update is supposed to solve.   My navigation system broke down on a cross country trip and required the dealer to reboot it.   Even my Tom Tom can be rebooted manually by me.

 on 03/02/17 16:32 PM (PST),CN ,2016 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Inscription 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),Mixed feeling after nearly a year of ownership," My wife and I purchased the car last year after narrowing down the choices to this and an MB GL350 diesel.  I preferred the Benz, but this car was for my wife and she liked it better.  Between the two it is the better overall value option.  Ours has every major option except the trailer hitch and HUD.  Overall, it's been a good car, but there are some nagging design faults that really detract from it.  First up is the HUD.  I'm 6' 2"", and it was not possible to adjust the system to permit me to see it clearly; the top edge was always cut off, hence one of the reasons we didn't get that option.  Next are the seats.  They are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had to suffer through.  After nearly a year of driving it I still can't adjust them to a comfortable position.  The seat bottoms literally pinch my butt on the driver's side.  On the passenger side my tail bone sits directly on the seam for the extendable thigh support.  The lumbar support in the seat back can't be set in a position that works for me for long periods.  The seats in our car are the 'contour' models (I think); maybe the 'comfort' seats don't have these issues.  For me, the 2nd row seats are far more comfortable.  My wife is 5' 3"" and she doesn't have any issues with the seats.  My recollection is the Swedes are pretty tall, so why can't they make a seat that fits a tall person?  The next item is the cruise control.  The controls are backwards in that a single button press adjust the speed up (or down) by 5 mph, while press and hold adjusts by 1 mph.  These actions should be reversed.  The infotainment/electronic systems occasionally glitch, though software updates seem to have generally improved their operation.  The most serious glitch, experienced by me and my wife separately, has been the emergency braking warning going off for no reason, accompanied by the automatic emergency braking.  This occurred to each of us on the highway.  Fortunately, traffic was light during both instances, and the action was momentary.  Fuel economy is, frankly, lousy considering the engine size.  We're averaging around 21-22 mpg in mixed driving.  The best we've managed was about 25 mpg on a 450-miles trip.  Our Odyssey's engine is nearly twice the size and that car gets nearly 30 mpg on the highway.  And, it's a larger car (and weighs the same).  Compounding the low fuel economy is the ridiculously small fuel tank.  18.5 gallons?  Seriously? It should be at least 20, preferably more given the lousy economy.  Volvo really missed an opportunity by not offering a V6, or bringing the diesel to the U.S.  On the plus side, the infotainment system is easy to use.  The ride with the air suspension is sublime.  It feels like a tank.  Fit and finish, and materials are first rate and every bit on par (or better) than the Germans.  The biggest plus in my book, though, is that my wife absolutely loves the car, so it's a keeper.",3.0,"Mixed feeling after nearly a year of ownership My wife and I purchased the car last year after narrowing down the choices to this and an MB GL350 diesel.

Not to mention it's much larger and much peppier engine.  My wife and myself also looked at the BMW X5 and mb gle and Audi Q7.  We found x5 to be very expensive and the BMW dealer by us has a horrible service department, but the SUV drove nicely and interior was nice but very similar to the Volvo but 8,700 more for comperable equipment.  The gle was a bit small and no third row, transmission was a bit rough when passing.  The q7 was very out dated, no technology features, no safety features, worst fuel economy, we have no idea how it was rated so highly, it felt like it was a decade behind the others.  We also looked at the Range Rover sport, this was a very nice SUV but over budget about 24,000 more than the Volvo.  When looking at the Volvo make sure you drive both regular motors we found the base t5 to be under powered and noisy.  But for a few grand more the t6 engine is very quick and the transmission reacts much smoother than my Mercedes Benz e350.  The fuel economy has been surprisingly good for a larger SUV about 24 mpg.   I definitely recommend the active cruise control and cornering head lights both are great options and the kids love the very large sunroof.  The iPad interface takes some time to get used to, but everything is voice command also and the dash board also cam be customized to view whatever you want.

I did all the research  online and the dealership was busy with everyone wanting to drive the XC90. Our first test drive was the T6 Momentum. It was AWFUL! There was a horrible burning smell and a wicked vibration that made my husband feel carsick in the back seat. I changed with him and I started to feel carsick in the back too. The shifting was really rough, the acceleration was poor, the seats were not comfortable at all. The salesman ask if we would be willing to try another. I wanted to like this car so we agreed.

To make it comparable to a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes, you need to step up to the Inscription trim and I would highly recommend it with the optional air suspension.  Without the air suspension the ride quality is average; with it, the ride is outstanding.  I had no intention of buying a Volvo, but was very surprised.  I drove all the competition extensively and bought an XC90 First Edition so it has every feature available.  The interior is amazing, the safety tech is unparalleled, and infotainment is great.  As for criticisms, the navigation system is not the best on the market, the car only has one USB port, and local mpg have been poorer than advertised.  However, on a recent trip from Phoenix to LA, we averaged almost 28 mpg.  I quickly got used to the touch tablet style interface and enjoy the ease of use.  I personally love the seats (heated/ventilated), Apple Car Play, heads up display, and the Bowers and Wilkens stereo will blow you away.  Again, safety features are amazing.  As for the competition, the X5 from the driverâs seat is a great vehicle, but it is smaller inside and the Volvo kills it in 2nd and 3rd row functionality and utility, which is what we needed.  The Lexus GX (keep in mind I really like Lexus and owned an RX for over a decade) feels heavy and sluggish compared to the Volvo.  The new Audi Q7 was not available when I bought and the older version was surprisingly tight inside.  The Merc GL is a bigger vehicle but when I optioned it out to match my Volvo First Edition from a feature standpoint it was over $90k.  The Volvo truly feels like a smaller vehicle than it is while driving and eats up highway miles.  My wife and I fight over who takes it each day.  I hope the long term reliability is above average.

So far I have put about 1000miles on the SUV, about 75% mileage comes from local driving - commuting to/from work, driving kids to school and other places etc.  I have yet to take a long trip or push the car to its limits.  Therefore it canât qualify as a complete ownership review.  But for whatever it worths, I share my $0.02 with current and will-be fellow Volvo owners.Maybe we start with some low lightsSensus Touch ScreenTechnologies are awesome, but also can be difficult to master. This is true in 2016 XC90.  Its central touch screen has 3 views to slide from left and right, plus a âcar settingâ view that is pulled from the top.  The screen navigation is complicated.  After two weeks, I still have trouble remembering how to get to certain settings. I tend to consider myself a techie and quite adept at picking up new things, Volvo central control proved that I am not as smart as I thought I was.Key fabItâs a classy design with leather wrapped around bulk of surface area.  It carries touch of a fine watch.   Function buttons are located on the either side, and that is where the trouble comes.  The buttons are small, difficult press and even more difficult to feel which is âlockâ or âunlockâ.  You will have to see it.  My key fab leather is blonde, matching the carâs interior.  However, Being in the pocket and rubbing against other stuff all the time isnât the formula to keep key fab clean.  The key fab frame is aluminum.  My key has received a couple of small dents on the frame so far.  Volvo, if you are reading the post, please make the frame stainless steel.  The aluminum frame doesnât match the leather wrap nor the $80K car price tag.Park assist, Camera - birdâs eye viewMy T8 comes with vision package, a great value and a must-have in my opinion. I especially love the synthesized bird eye view of the car.  I found it much more useful than park assist.  I, for one when equipped  with the overview camera, donât have trouble maneuvering the car regardless parallel parking or back up parking.  Park assist, on the other hand, reacts slowly.  While I can see its usefulness for many, I only tested it for a couple of time before reverting to much faster manual parking.  BTW, park assist did work quite well when I used it. The birdâs eye view image becomes wonky when other tall objects are nearby.  This perhaps is the only knock on the vision package. I think it can be corrected via software algorithm.  I hope Volvo has a future software update for this.Voice recognition Works about 80-85% of time.  The number might seem high, but in day-to-day usage, it is not very dependable.  Volvo obviously has some catch-up to do with Google etc in the voice recognition domain.One USB port and no SD card slotDealer told me XC90 accepts micro SD card, but I am unable to insert the micro SD card to the slot next to the glove box release button.  No place in the manual refers to micro SD card either.  This interlude attests how much a dealer knows about this new vehicle.  And one USB port in this connected era spells major inconvenience for the owners.  I have to keep swapping between my phone, USB stick and passengerâs phones.Having said all of that, there is a lot to like, or may I say the word love, about XC90 T8.  First and foremost,Quite and SmoooooothThe twin engine combo has far exceeded my expectation.  The transition between the electric and gas engine is so seamless that I often fail to notice the switch taking place.   Thanks to the hybrid powertrain, the car starts with electric engine with zero noise and gas engine kicks in when more power is needed or cruising at high speed.  The result? no 4 cylinder whining at low gear.   the start/stop also works fabulously well in T8.  In many way, the car waltzes around with V8 like grace, smoothness and tranquility.  Not only twin engines augment each other well, regenerative braking and mechanical braking work in perfect harmony.  I donât believe any non-racing driver would be able to tell which braking is at work unless he peeks at the dashboard.PowerIâve not floored the gas pedal and rev the engine to the red line.  The car is still breaking in, I have to be easy on the throttle.  So I canât verify the 5.3 sec from 0-60 mph, yetâ¦.  Even with that, XC90 T8 has plenty of juice at the low end, cruising around effortlessly with 5 people on board.  With a gentle push on on gas pedal, freeway overtaking comes with ease.  400 horse power brings about the reassuring feeling. While I wonât use it every time when taking the freeway on-ramp, I know all the ponies are there there to haul the heavy SUV when I need to.Touch SensusExcept Telsa which I havenât used,  Volvoâs touch screen beats Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lexus etc. in my opinion.

Overall, I think Volvo is trying to save money by making subtle changes/upgrades to current model vehicles but they are trying to make big leaps when they re-design their vehicles which introduces too many changes in one package which in my opinion creates too many potential problems. Also, support for Volvo along the Gulf Coast is very weak. There are only two dealerships in my area and they are both 30 more minutes away.

On our Honda CRV and Chevy Equinox we always meet or exceed the EPA estimated MPG, so I donât think it our driving habits.  Either Volvo over estimated MPG or who knows.

The car does not have a dip-stick.  The manual does not describe how to do it  My wife or daughter still canât check the oil level using the information system.  Checking the oil is much like running  old DOS commands from function keys on your keyboard.  The engine does need oil added between the 10,000 mile interval oil changes.

The car is driven daily already has close to 13500 miles so I have definitely broken it in and spent lots of time in this vehicle.  I have to admit this car was not my first choice.  I wanted a Honda CRV.  I traded a 2004 Honda CRV with over 160K miles for this suv.  I never had any issues with that car or my Honda before that one.  One major complaint is the lack of an owner's manual.  The manual is in the car's infotainment system or you have to download it to a phone or other device.  This is really inconvenient, especially when experiencing a problem.  Twice I experienced turn signal and windshield wiper malfunctions.  Warnings were popping up in the center console and the infotainment system (and don't get me started on how cumbersome that is to operate).   Neither functions operated so makes vehicle unable to be operated in any precipitation.  Very scary to drive when you have 3 children in the car and losing functions.  Also received a battery failure warning on the first occasion.  1st time back to the dealership they had to wipe the computer clean and download all the software again.  Took hrs.  Was promised car fixed.  2nd time (yesterday) they replaced the turn signal and wiper module which was defective.  Took hrs.  Was promised was fixed.  We shall see. It is sad when you carry a towel in the car to wipe mist, etc off you windshield.  The dealer showed me pages of error codes that were downloaded from the car from malfunctions.   I think there is another problem with the computer because now it is taking a long time to load the instrument panel.  Also seem to be getting strange images showing up on screen.  Hard to describe.  The nav updates constantly and that was also fixed yesterday by re-downloading the software.  Dealer said it was stuck in a downloading loop.  The nav is terrible, we call it the crazy gps because it sends us all over the place.  I hook up the android auto and use google gps instead.  12V power outlet in front center console already blew a fuse.  Never had that happen in any vehicle I have ever owned.  Door trim on driver's side passenger door replaced due to manufacturing defect.  I have begun taking pictures and videos of malfunction warnings and irregularities have been experiencing.  So I have documentation of all issues.  So far everything covered under warranty but worried about future.

These headrest and seat features have caused my wife such significant hip and neck pain that she is seeing a physical therapist and has required her to switch to driving my Audi A6. I now have been assigned to the XC60 which was not my choice of vehicles. Until just recently we had yet to get over 24 mpg on a trip, and the city mileage rarely exceeded 15 mpg.

The Audi seats hurt her back so we sold it back to the dealer with less than 2000 miles on it (OUCH!). Inscription has amazing seat adjustments, features and comfort. Terrible window glare off dash during daytime unless drive wears sun glasses. Visibility is good, though the BLIS could have been made more pronounced in the side mirror. No mfg compares to Audi on the BLIS system visibility.

Definitely Volvo has earned his position as luxury brand. I did test drive Audi Q5, MB GLC and BMW X3. I leaned towards the Volvo, for excellent design exterior and interior, although I have to admit it was a difficult choice, except for the MB GLC which was ruled out right away due to its outdated features and poor exterior design. The XC 60 is extremelly comfortable to drive, with the Inscription trim it looks awesome, modern and offering a sense of peace and quiet inside. I will focus my review on things that should be better (hence my 4 star rate instead of 5). Some of the materials in the lower part of the dashboard, doors and central console should be of better quality for a $ 54K vehicle. Performance is its weakest part, I got the T6 because compared to Audi Q5 or BMW X3 acceleration and quick shifting was subpar on the T5, with the T6 it gets better (in dynamic mode) but still it is not an Audi, so if you are looking for spirited performance go with the Q5 or the X3. Fuel consumption is poor, and definitely below what Volvo advertises. Noisy during acceleration, once you cruise it is quiet. On the Inscription trim premium sound should be standard (as it is in the Q5), so I decided to go with the regular audio system (definitely not great sound. Go with the Bowers & Wilkins premium sound if you can afford it. It is worthy). Suspension is on the harsh side.

To me, the design of the Volvo is the most modern and elegant of the bunch. The engine on the T5 is on par with the Base models of the other brands. (@250HP and around the same torque) The cabin set up for convenience of the driver, the blend of technology and amenities on a simple yet elegant design made the XC60 the best. I was a little concerned with the performance and almost decided to go with the T6 but I honestly could not justify the extra money, the engine performs just fine for the type of driving I do.

One characteristic that I have really liked is the suspension. My only test drive was on a XC90 T5 and on that occasion I noticed some plushness to the suspension, specially when compared t my old BMW 328i.

First, the power lock on the driver side door decided not to function one day, but hasn't repeated yet.  During a heavy rain, the auto folding mirrors would not fold back out after turning the car on and off several times.

Aside from scheduled maintenance  volvo has either repaired or replaced under warranty the following: Battery twice ( car had to be towed in both times), plastic piece by rear seat headrest broke, plastic piece by rear seat fold down lever broke, AC condenser, gas gauge sending and receiving unit, rear back up camera, dash computer,rear hatch actuator,   Windshield was leaking water inside, has now developed a bad smell they believe is mildew caused by water getting under carpet from leaking windshield so they shampooed carpet, car still smells.  Based on repair history of first 5 yrs of ownership the time when the least repairs should occur it is obvious the car has issues. Now that warranty is up I contacted volvo explaining that I didn't think it fair that I find myself in a position that I pay $43000 for a car, maintain it well, has less than 50,000 miles and it appears I must sell it to avoid hefty future repairs. I asked them to  recognize that this is not their best manufactured vehicle and must be outside of what they believe is acceptable. I asked they either preferably  extend the warranty or if not provide a very good incentive to trade in on a newer volvo.  Their first response was to tell me that if any of the repairs made broke a second time they would ""consider"" at that time making the repair.  I asked to speak to the person making that decision so we could discuss and was told I cannot.  I wrote another letter to volvo a bit stronger and low and behold I received a call from the servicing dealer (Jaguar Land Rover Porsche Volvo of Greenville).â  I went in and  met contact at dealer.  He looked at history and told me the following:  The car was out of service 28 days in the 5 yrs, it had been in 11 times for service in 5 yrs,  (This doesn't seem too bad however when something broke we lived with it until it was time for next scheduled service as we live about 40 min drive from dealer.)  Had I had to pay for those repairs it would have cost me approx $5000.  My feeling was that $5000 for repairs in the first 5 yrs was horrible this is when car should need to be repaired the least.  He then told me that bringing it in 11 times in 5 yrs was below average.  When I told him that Volvo cannot be proud of the repair history of this car and cannot think it is usual and customary he said that two of the repairs added to $2600 and if we separated out those two repairs the repairs history of $2400 was pretty good. While this is all going on they price my car for a trade in and give me a price of $11,000 that would be a 75% depreciation in 5 yrs  for a vehicle with no visible damage inside or out with less than 50,000 miles (kbb prices median trade in as $14,000).

This is our 4th Volvo since 1990. The other 3 were wagons (a 240 and 2 V70s).

Good price incentives in July encouraged me to buy new.

The XC60 is a very comfortable car with supportive front seats and enough leg, shoulder and head room for my above average male body size. The drive-e engine delivers surprisingly good fuel economy for a car this heavy, yet acceleration also is more than adequate for my needs. The leather seats are beautiful, although I would have preferred the cloth upholstery that has held up so well in my old V70 for 12 years.  Another thing I miss is the fold-flat front passenger seat in the V70, which allowed me occasionally to carry long items such as lumber (but then, I wouldn't want to do that in a car this nice). The infotainment system keeps me entertained and informed with more choices than I really need. It's a little more complicated than I would have preferred and I'm afraid it will seem dated within a few years. The ""premier"" version is nicely equipped as-is, without adding expensive options.  If you're comparing alternatives, Subaru is another (less expensive) make I'd consider, especially if you want AWD.

I get about 28 MPG on the highway using regular gas.  I generally cruise between 75 and 80 mph, and the XC60 is a fun, satisfying, soothing car to get home in.And while itâs not a sports car, the XC60 is also fun and comfortable on twisty back roads.  Itâs small enough to feel nimble and pointableânot at all trucky.  I canât compare it to an X3 or Q5, but it compares favorably to my previous Mazda3, especially given the Volvoâs different mission in life. Good steering feel, balance, grip, and braking.The seats are great once you get them right.  That took some doing but now I have a great position saved in memory.  The leather and other materials seem nice now, but a year-old used one I looked at had not held up well.  It had done time in New MexicoâIâm hoping the heat was a factor.The only feature I would change is the start-stop system.  Itâs an interesting idea and sometimes works well, but more often is an annoyance.  It should be permanently defeatable, instead of having to be turned off every time.  I also think a back-up camera should be standard, especially from a company known for safety.  And itâs a little more rattly than the Japanese cars Iâve owned, but I kind of expected that.Overall this is a great car for me right now.  Comfortable, classy, fuel-efficient, satisfying to drive, and, as long as itâs reliable, Iâm looking forward to my three daughters using up whateverâs left of it when Iâm done.",4.0,"Great car for a long commute I bought a 2016 XC60 T5 Premier in Flamenco Red with the Soft Beige leather interior.

Not only are volvos safe, but there also comfortable, stylish/perform well, dependable, and affordable. I am a very picky person when it comes to cars and it takes a lot for me to consider a car. When I look at buying a car I look at the overall styling of it, if it is comfortable or not, if it is dependable, but above all I look at how safe it is and in my opinion volvo blows all of these categories out of proportion.SAFETY- As I said before Volvo has been setting the safety standard for years; they have come out with everything from the three point seat belt or pedestrian detection with full auto brake to auto pilot system on cars. Volvo cares deeply about the safety of their buyers and unlike other car brands that put luxury first or convenience they put safety first. All Volvos come standard with a pre-collision system called city safety. In my opinion volvo cars are the safest cars on the road today.COMFORTABLE- Volvo also cares about how comfortable its passengers are. Volvo has gone as far to have special seats designed by orthopedic surgeons to make the ride of a volvo more comfortable. They use very nice soft to the touch materials in their cars that its passenger appreciate.STYLING AND PERFORMANCE- Volvo has sleek designs that set them apart from other auto maker from there Thor Hammer headlights to their distinctive long LED taillights. When you see a Volvo on the road (especially the new ones) you can tell it's a Volvo because of the sleek styling of it.I think that Volvo does a great job of making their cars head turners. For years Volvo did an ok job in the performance, but in the last decade they have really been improving the performance of their cars. All their cars come standard with turbocharge engines, but for those who want a little more of a driving experience like me, you can get a special line of Volvo called the R-Design. The R-designs come with special turbo engines tuned by the Swedish racing company Polestar (Polestar also tunes the suspension of the car). I own a Volvo XC60 R-Design which is a crossover and it feels like Iâm driving a sports car like the Lexus IS or BMW 3 Series.Dependability- Volvos are very reliable I have never had a major issue with mine and neither have my family members who have one. There a little more expensive to work on but theyâre worth it.AFFORDABILITY- Volvos have a long range of price tags, but for what they are there very reasonably priced. There prices range from lower $30,000-well over $90,000 in the U.S., but you can get a year old volvo in the 20's.",5.0,"Safety and comfort Review for VolvoVolvo has been around for decades and have been setting the safety standard for years.

Not sure if my experience is unusual or not but I've noticed many other owners of the same have had not so go comments about owning theirs.  However, I only have a couple of issues to be noted.  First, I did have to replace the Turbo at about 80k.  This was the largest repair expense I've had as of yet.  Also, I learned that when this Volvo recommends the oil change frequency, it means it.  Had I paid attention to my oil changes, it would of saved my turbo and I most likely wouldn't of had to replace it.  Oil change as recommended a must!

It's GREAT in the snow, I drove in horrible conditions when literally no one else was on the road because it was so awful out there, and I was 100% fine (granted I grew up driving in blizzards, so I know what I'm doing).  I've never felt safer in any other car.  The acceleration is good, the stereo is wonderful and has lots of ways to adjust it. If you are a bass person....the bass is very very good.  Now, the bad:   I swear Volvo programs/designs these cars to be fantastic until the warranty is over.  I started having so many problems when mine was done.  The batteries kept dying, I had to get three new batteries in three years, two in an 8 month period. The electronics started acting weird, and there was a mysterious leak in the windshield that I couldn't find, and the dealerships claimed they couldn't find it either, even tho every time it rained I had water dripping down my windshield. Notice that dealerships was plural? Yeah...I went to a ton of different Volvo dealerships for maintenance due to moving around a lot....and I had problems at ALL of them.  Constantly trying to rip me off, charge me for unnecessary things...they even went as far as telling me that I needed a new timing belt....when the car has a timing chain. There is no timing belt. Another thing that made me think that the car was programmed to break after the warranty was over was that every time the ""regular maintenance"" notification showed up, I noticed that if I didn't take it into the dealership fast enough, things would mysteriously start breaking.  Electronics, etc. That notification is on a timer per certain amount of miles driven. It will show up no matter whats going on with the car. It made no sense, and it never happened until the warranty was over. And I've heard the same complaint from multiple other Volvo owners.And the gas milage is terrible. I get 17 miles per gallon. Ugh.  I've heard they have improved that on the new ones tho.I now have about $8,000 worth of things to fix on the damn thing, including the rear differential, and so needless to say I'm looking for a new car.

 on 12/19/15 20:09 PM (PST),David ,2013 Volvo XC60 SUV T6 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),What did I get myself into?," I bought a 2013 Volvo XC60 3.0L V6 Turbo. I love how fast the car drives however, I've owned the car for 6 months and its been in the shop 4x since. There was an issue with the alignment but that was resolved (I had to take it to the dealer because when I took it to firestone 2x in 2 different states the car still didn't drive straight). I then had a problem where the car would not read most of my audio files on my usb, and then if there was a whole folder that it couldn't read it would completely stop working and I needed to stop the car and turn it off and on, (sometimes that didn't resolve the issue) that issue came back 2 more times since. I've had to replace the rotors twice already. It's almost as if they make them out of plastic. I had replace them because they warped, it made the steering wheel shake violently when I went 45 mph or faster. The car is a very rough ride, so if you have back issues I would look at something else. I drove for 11 hours and by the time we got to our destination it felt like somebody took a baseball bat to my back. I was looking for a reliable AWD vehicle because I live where there is a ton of snow and ice, also the closest Volvo shop is 4 hours away so I can't exactly pop in if I have an issue. This car is not that! I don't hate everything about the car, I love how stable it is at high speeds. I live where the speed limits are 80 mph and with this car passing is no issue. When you put your foot to the floor, the car goes into cheetah mode and takes off. Its AWD system is not the best, with its 60(front)/40(back) split. My sister has an 2013 Outback and that cars AWD system is a lot better than the Volvo's, hands down. The BLIS package has some issues, it gives you false readings quiet often, that being said it saved me a few times. I have LED headlights that have the active bending feature which helps when driving at night through passes. I like this cars parking sensors, they've saved me countless times. I get 17-18 mpg around town, and 19-20 mpg on the highway however, I do have a heavy foot. I can deal with most of the issues this car has but, the rotors anger me every time I think about them. So the question is would I buy this car if I knew everything I know now? My answer most likely would be no. My reasoning is mainly that the rotors are expensive and putting down that much money so often is problematic. Not mentioning how much time this takes, last time it took the dealership 5 days to replace them. So if you are a fan of back pain, and you have money to waste, and you have all the time in the world this car is the perfect car for you!

I get 17-18 mpg around town, and 19-20 mpg on the highway however, I do have a heavy foot. I can deal with most of the issues this car has but, the rotors anger me every time I think about them. So the question is would I buy this car if I knew everything I know now? My answer most likely would be no. My reasoning is mainly that the rotors are expensive and putting down that much money so often is problematic. Not mentioning how much time this takes, last time it took the dealership 5 days to replace them. So if you are a fan of back pain, and you have money to waste, and you have all the time in the world this car is the perfect car for you!

My previous car was a 2000 Buick LeSabre so I was looking for a vehicle that provided a similar ride but had a bit of fun factor to it. I also need a car that has good seats as I have a bad back. The car is also parked on a city street, so I wanted something smaller that could easily be parked and not get dented. I looked at a 2015 Mini Cooper S, a 2014VW GTI, and this car. The Mini was my favorite when it came to its quirky design but it ends there; the mechanics and overall comfort was pathetic for such an expensive vehicle. I also decided against it when I learned that the Hardtop failed a side impact safety test (which the dealership claimed they fixed by adding more interior padding). The next car I tried was the VW GTI. It was an okay vehicle but the ride was harsh, the seats were hard and not as supportive as older models, and the materials were just cheap (worse than the Mini and that's saying a lot). I then found my 2010 Volvo C30. The seats are impressive but I guess that's to be expected as they are the only ones in the market to be designed by orthopedic surgeons. I was greatly surprised to discover that the C30 has a softer ride than the Buick LeSabre. The car has great vision and safety, as it has large windows and is equipped with BLIS (though I have not turned it on yet). The vehicle also weighs over 4300 pounds, which is heavier by at least 1500 pounds compared to the Mini and VW. The Volvo C30 attracts a lot of attention wherever I go because of its unique design and its great engine note when starting or accelerating. The Volvo has also been very reliable with only oil changes needed. The only downside, but not really for a car this awesome, is the mileage. On premium, I can only get 22.8 mpg in mixed driving but highway mpg easily reaches 32 mpg.",5.0,"Sweet Ride!
