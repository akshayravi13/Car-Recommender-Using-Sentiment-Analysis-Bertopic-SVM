My XK8 cost me $5800 in 2015 with perfect body & interior, no accidents and with the engine upgrades already done & convertible top hydraulic lines replaced. After new tires, shocks, motor mounts, front brakes, mass airflow meter, valve cover gaskets, plugs & filters, she now runs & drives like new for a total all-in price of around $11k. I couldn't be happier.UPDATE: 15 months into ownership of my '99, I've spent very little on the car except for oil & gas. Classic/specialty auto insurance (Hagerty) has reduced the cost of comprehensive insurance to less than $400 annually on an agreed value of $15k. Costs since the initial review have been limited to a new Jaguar ignition coil ($128) & professionally repainting the front & rear bumpers (approx. $600), a project I intended since purchase. There have been no other costs; everything works great on the car & it runs & drives beautifully. I still marvel at how much car you get with the XK8, compared with much more expensive GTs like an Aston Martin DB7 or (especially now) Porsche 911. It took nearly 20 years for the XK8's predecessor, the XJS, to begin to appreciate in value, so it will be awhile before XK8 values start climbing. In the meantime, buy the best accident-free XK8 you can afford, have a local Jaguar specialist maintain/service it, and take care of it like it deserves. Great value, great motoring, great experience.UPDATE (5/16/17): 30 months in & still loving my XK8 - she's a keeper. A few months ago, I decided to fix some miscellaneous leaks (oil, coolant), a part of owning any British car. My local Jag specialist replaced the coolant bypass hose, water distribution pipe & thermostat housing, plus some o-rings & the coolant cap. The shop also replaced the oil pan gasket & drain plug. The fixes weren't cheap but they worked. Costs: parts ($321.32) & labor ($284.20) totaled $624.80 w. tax. The car is now approaching 130k mi. & drives as sweet as ever. I'm planning some road trips for the summer, including a couple of British car shows. The body & paint is excellent, the black leather interior has that aromatic richness of Connolly leather that I love, and the power top, AC & electricals all work perfectly. It's still a few more years before XK8s start their upswing in value as a modern classic, so find a good 'un now while they're cheap & enjoy!UPDATE (5/17/18): Quick update on my XK8 after 3+ years of ownership - she still looks great, comes out of the garage on sunny days, and runs like a top. No issues at all during the last year - I've added about 2000 miles since the last update. Hard to believe my XK8 is approaching 20 years old, but it's true. I sometimes get a yen to sell it & get something else, but what would take its place? A drive in the country, top up or down, is all it takes to remind me what a great car it really is.

The styling, handling, overall feel of the entire car is fantastic. I drive between Washington DC, NYC, Philadelphia monthly and has not let me down once. The Diesel engine is totally awesome and I always get fabulous fuel economy. I never have a problem finding diesel fuel anywhere either which is one of the first questions people ask when I tell them that is indeed Diesel.

The plastic bottom door area rattles sometimes depending on the type of music you are playing and drives me nuts. Another thing that happens while listening to music loudly is that the piano black veneer trim I think rattles slightly too off and on depending on the song. I notice this more when the bass is tuned up anymore than half way balanced. The backseat legroom is terrible and always feeling like people are squeezing into the back seat. I am under 6 ft tall so someone sitting beside shouldn't ever be a problem unless they are taller than I am. Also getting in and out of the car is a little difficult.

613, on 02/19/17 07:19 AM (PST),First Time Jag Owner ,2017 Jaguar XE Diesel 20d Premium 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbodiesel 8A),LOVE my Jaguar DIESEL," I only buy diesels because I plan on keeping a car 12  or more years and a diesel is the only way to make that happen.   I had three VWs before the Jag.  Before the VWs I had a 2002 Ford F250 Crew Cab. I started with a 2012 VW Golf TDI.  Had an accident (not my fault) that nearly killed me, literally.  So I upgraded to a 2013 VW Passat TDI.  Got rear ended twice, not my fault.  Car was curse so I got a 2014 VW Passat TDI that VW had to buy back from me.  Used myhopstoch dot com because Edmunds and Truecar told me to pay $1 OVER MSRP.  Auto Trader gave me a cert to pay $700 OVER MSRP.   Hopscotch saved my $8K.   So about the Jaguar, love it!   The Jaguar website is a little misleading.  It says the 20d Premium has everything the 20d has, like SiriusXM.  Mine did not come with, so I have a mess of wires and because the roof is aluminum, the magnet won't stick.  The car halls ass.  I was doing 95 on the highway in the middle of the night and would have sworn I was doing 70.  The car comes with four driving modes, rain/snow (starts in second gear),  Economy, Normal, and Dynamic.  I love Dynamic.  The speedometer and RPM gauge turns red like it is angry.  I'm averaging 42 mpg city and highway. The Jag comes with not only a 5 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper, but also comes with all scheduled maintenance for 5 year / 60,000 miles.  The free maintenance is a few grand in savings.  I'm not tall, so it gives the back seat more parking room.  If you are tall, that will take away space from the back seat passengers.  As far as the technology, I'm good with it.  Had a great mapping system.  My only complaint is it doesn't like my Texas accent.  If I had to add/change anything, first I would put a place for the keys!  I have lost the keys in the car and had to search around for them!  I'd like something between the inside edges of the front seats to prevent things from falling under the seat.  Jag needs to add a few options to all models, like proximity key entry. I loved walking up to my VW and just opening the door because my keys were in my pocket.   The car has a 12v port in the drivers cubby in the center console.  Since you have to run some wires out of it, it needs notches in the cubby lid for the wires to get through.  The apps are okay.  The remote app is the one I use the most to make sure I locked it and rolled up the windows and start it to pre-cool the car down.  In Texas we don't let them run to heat them up, we run them to cool them down before we get in!  The trunk room is more than adequate.  As far as the apps, you have to run them through your phone into the car.  It is easier to just run any apps thru the blue tooth from the phone.  No sense in running the app through my phone into the car entertainment system.  It just adds a step that isn't necessary.  It should come standard with SiriusXM.  SiriusXM are fools for not allowing that and giving a three month trial.  The vision package is very cool.  I have the cold weather package that I will be able to use a few times a year.   The front seats need some lumbar support adjustment pillows.  I absolutely love the car.  I can tell when I change it to dynamic mode.  The steering tightens up, the suspension gets stiffer and it moves.  I was doing 98mph and getting 57 mpg according to the car computer.  I'm averaging 42 mph in mixed highway and city use.  Jaguar know how to make you feel special.  I got a box from them.  It had all sorts of different little panels on the use of the infotainment system and four tire stem caps with little jaguars on them.  I must admit, it made me feel special and like they cared.  I have breakdown and SOS buttons and I think I have them for at least 5 years.  I wanted a diesel. Chevy couldn't tell me when the Cruze was coming out and now I'm glad.  This may be a sedan, but drop it into dynamic mode and it is a sports car!  Have 2500 miles on it and not a single problem.

Save the higher-rated and, in many ways, more accommodating service of BMW, everything about the XE has given me a newfound appreciation for Jaguar.  The now iconic F-Type put Jaguar back on the map from years of dullness and now the XE (and especially its sportier variants) are breathing life back into the Jaguar brand.  From the sleek and elegant yet sporty design of the XE, there is very little that I don't love about it so far having put about 5k miles on my white knight 2017 35t.  The acceleration and performance is gripping and the handling is on par and, at least in some aspects, even better than German engineering.  Being on top of the game for some many years, it's impossible not to notice a scale back on quality of some German car brands albeit with simultaneous increases.  However, with this price point and a few tweaks on design and technology, I believe Jaguar can make the XE, the most formidable opponent of the 3 series/4 series and A4/S4 and C-Class models that's been seen in many years.

However, with this price point and a few tweaks on design and technology, I believe Jaguar can make the XE, the most formidable opponent of the 3 series/4 series and A4/S4 and C-Class models that's been seen in many years.

The 2017 Jaguar XE's cabin features an attractive, uncluttered dashboard with clean lines, but it lacks the sort of visual flair that made the original Jag XF and current XJ so special. Its quality also leaves a lot to be desired. Compared to what's in its German luxury sedan competitors, the door trim looks and feels a bit flimsy, the trim that wraps around the dash is unremarkable, and the dash top itself is shiny and a bit coarse. Our test car also had more squeaks and rattles than usual, and in general, the XE's cabin feels as if it belongs to a nice midsize family sedan rather than an entry-level luxury one.”Let me state that I don’t know what on earth they are talking about – possibly drinking the BMW Kool-Aid too much.  Nothing in the XE interior looks or feels flimsy.  I have driven several current BMW 3-series examples, and also have my wife’s (costly) BMW X-3 as a direct comparison.  To say the XE lacks in quality, assembly, materials or even visual appeal compared to them is absurd.  Frankly, not much to choose from or any significant differences between these models.  Having driven my XE for 3K miles now, on very rough Western PA roads, I have no squeaks or rattles.  Everything seems extremely solid and well-screwed together.  And “dash top itself is shiny”?  What did you guys do – spill a drink on it?  My dash is not the least bit “shiny.”  It makes me wonder if Edmund’s drove some beaten-up early press-car for their test.  In short, I think their interior assessment is hogwash. And BTW, of course the XE’s interior is not as remarkable as the XF or XJ – would you expect it to be, since those cars occupy a much higher price point?      The car is very fast, light on its feet, and with a superior ride/handling combination than the BMW 3 series.  In normal conditions, it performs and handles like a RWD car, and its limits seem very high.  Actually, it is quite tossable, handling with a responsiveness and confidence that is reassuring.  The 8-speed auto transmission is a great one, and paddle shifting is fast and smooth if you want to do things manually.   I appreciate the “Dynamic” and “Sport” modes especially, which make a noticeable difference in shifts and throttle response.  Steering feel is surprisingly communicative for an electric system.  Brakes are strong, as you would expect.  I have driven the XE several times in winter conditions, and the AWD traction system performs flawlessly.  I find the clean and sleek looks, especially with optional 19” wheels, to be compelling. Thankfully, when Jaguar convinced Ian Callum to jump from Aston Martin, he brought his superior design sense with him.  The fact that A-M made some of the most beautiful cars in the world under his guidance, and Jaguar now has adopted a similar understated but handsome design language is not a coincidence.  While BMW pretty much rehashes the same themes year after year (with the exception of the bizarre Chris Bangle era) and other luxury makes like Lexus have just plain lost their minds in overblown design elements, Jaguars look clean, fast, well balanced, and fresh.  The trick of course will be if they can progress in the years to come without being too derivative. Overall, to me the XE is a more appealing car than the 3 series BMW, and unlike  Jag’s previous 3-series contender – the ill-fated X-type – it represents true competition.  One cannot be faulted for picking a BMW 3, since there is much to offer there.  After two BMW 135’s, which I enjoyed, I got spooked off BMW due to the bad electrical gremlins I experienced in both cars.

It is a blast to drive. It feels like a sports car in terms of steering, acceleration, and feel but the ride is smooth and confident.  It is amazing how Jaguar was able to retain a smooth ride yet deliver this type of performance and handling. You really need to drive it to believe it. The design of this vehicle is gorgeous and you won't see other examples of yourself everywhere you go. The relative exclusivity of the F-Pace was a selling point for me. There are a few negatives with this vehicle however. My biggest complaint is interior quality. My Prestige trim level was $55,000. Other vehicles in this price range far exceed the interior quality of the F-Pace. There is a great deal of hard plastic and I'm concerned about the quality of the leather, but time will tell. In addition, the standard infotainment system is slow to respond and I've had trouble changing channels on the Sirius/XM radio as it often gets locked on one channel.

Recently while walking through a parking garage, my eye caught a very uniquely styled SUV.  I immediately walked over to it to investigate what was it?   To my surprise it was the F Pace - ""S"" model Jaguar, SUV.  Holy smokes this car is gorgeous.  I rushed home to educate myself on this car by stopping in to the Edmunds.com website.  I was able to research and compare this car to other competitive models.  Here is what I found.  It is the widest of all SUV's in this category.  The F Pace - ""S"" model has that European interior styling in red and black - with red stitching accenting it's curves; very sharp and appealing.  The drivers seat is very comfortable and mimics the feeling of being held tightly in the cockpit of a race car.  (It is very comfortable).  The cargo space is far more generous than other competitors.  I have had this car since April 24th, 2017 and have been anxiously waiting to write this review, allowing ample time to report on it's many features.  Here is what I have found.  This car is FAST - I can't emphasize that enough.  I also own a 2013 Challenger - Hemi 375 HP.  The Jag's super charged 3.0 6 cyl. 380 HP engine is fabulous and just as fast - however the Challenger is a 6 sp. manual shift for the thrill seeker in me!  (Female - 63 years old!)  The transmission shifts smooth and seamless, unlike my 2014 Cherokee that had a  8 spd. choppy transmission (replaced after 2 years - a known problem with this model year).  ""Highly responsive"" is the way I would describe not only the acceleration but the steering, rode handling, and breaking system in this Jaguar, SUV.  I have encouraged my family members to drive it and give me their critique - all agree - it is: #1 FAST, #2 Very Responsive,  #3 Comfortable,  #4 Smooth ride.    A few reviewers have commented on the placement of the power window buttons, I really don't mind that they are located on the window ledge.  I tend to drive with my left arm on the ledge anyway.  Yes, the 16.6 gallon gas tank could be bigger.  It takes premium gas, not a deal breaker to me as the Challenger does too.  I wish the gas cap was a locking one, instead of spring loaded.  (Hopefully the days of putting sugar in someones gas tank are a thing of the past).  The touch screen is easy to navigate with only one caveat; changing the radio stations from either the steering wheel or the touch screen results in a 2-3 second delay.  In other words, it doesn't immediately switch to another radio station at first touch.  When using the voice command option whether the turn by turn navigation, or voice activated call system- it results in hearing a soothing women's voice, unlike Alexa and Siri.  The navigation system is accurate and easy to use once you adapt to it.  The interior luminescent night lighting is sharp!  The rear camera feature that can be viewed with just a touch of a button at any time, even when the car is in motion - is awesome.  Speaking of the backup camera - it provides a wide view that is extremely clear - seemingly HD quality.  A few things could be improved upon in my opinion; I don't like the position location of the volume/channel control adjacent to the vehicle information section positioned on the left side of the steering wheel.  For some reason when changing the radio station from that location, I end up hitting the middle ""OK"" button which sends you into a menu of car information, such as the lane departure settings, or front collision settings.  I find it a little annoying.   It seems that car manufacturers are compelled to be eco efficient.  When stopped at a light, with your foot on the brake, the car engine shuts off.  Once you lift your foot from the brake the engine restarts immediately.  This takes some getting used to, but the good news is, you can turn it off with a touch of a button, anytime.  I love having the option to turn something off.  There are 3 modes in which to drive this car in; eco (highway, rode trip mode), normal, and sport.  There are some differences when switching from normal to sport - but honestly, this car is so fast in normal mode - I personally don't feel the sport mode is necessary.  If I need anymore speed under my foot, I just switch to my Challenger - 6 spd Manual - Hemi, for that thrill ride ""fix.""   My major dilemma with this car is whether or not I buy it after the 3 year lease is up.  I love it so much, I can't imagine turning it in.  I have never leased a car before.  I never thought I could afford to drive a Jag!  By comparison, a fully loaded Ford Explorer, Lexus, Volvo XC 90, Lincoln MKC, or Lexus - all fall into the range of what this car costs.

I am a female and my husband hates salesmen so I typically test drive by myself.  I have had the new F-Pace in my sights for a while and test drove it and bought it the next day.  I have a heavy foot and have owned a 71 Mercury XR7, 84 Dodge Daytona Turbo, 2000 Mercedes E 430, 2008 Lincoln Navigator and now the Jaguar.  I test drove both the diesel and the 3.V-6 Cvl.  The diesel was a little more than I wanted to spend so I opted for the gasoline engine and I love it!  For some reason the sport mode feels better on the streets in my neighborhood and it purrs on the highway.  I bought the white with black wheels.  The wheels are growing on me but I wanted chrome, which was not offered and the salesman stressed that no wheel swapping was allowed.  The standard wheels looked dull and bland to me. I may switch them out after a couple of years.  I want to see how the long the black holds up. We are tall people and have plenty of room up front.  All I want in a new car is leather seats, a sun roof, satellite radio and some get up and go! I like just about everything about the suv but there are a few things that I feel should have been included on a $50,000 plus vehicle.  1. Why isn't back up sensors standard.  I have the camera but it us useless without the alert from a sensor. 2. The 12 V power socket that located inside the center compartment is useless unless you leave your phone inside the thing. My phone won't fit because I have something else there, no space, and the lid won't close over the cord.  I have to use the rear seat plug.  I do love that the electronics are easy to operate.  I used the remote start twice and it worked fine.  I have only had the car one week.  I am still getting use to all the gadgets and trying to figure out what all I have.  The quick start guide is great and helpful although I have yet to figure out why the car sometimes turns off when I place it in park.  I will make an appointment for someone to come out and go over it all in a few weeks as they offer this as a perk.  I am keeping a running list of questions because they are some options that I can't figure out if I have or not.  Overall, I love the F-Pace.  I wish I could have afforded the Sport  but I am very satisfied.  I have only seen one other F-Pace on the road.  The car gets plenty of looks and I have had people ask me what I am driving.

I have had the new F-Pace in my sights for a while and test drove it and bought it the next day.  I have a heavy foot and have owned a 71 Mercury XR7, 84 Dodge Daytona Turbo, 2000 Mercedes E 430, 2008 Lincoln Navigator and now the Jaguar.  I test drove both the diesel and the 3.V-6 Cvl.  The diesel was a little more than I wanted to spend so I opted for the gasoline engine and I love it!  For some reason the sport mode feels better on the streets in my neighborhood and it purrs on the highway.  I bought the white with black wheels.  The wheels are growing on me but I wanted chrome, which was not offered and the salesman stressed that no wheel swapping was allowed.  The standard wheels looked dull and bland to me. I may switch them out after a couple of years.  I want to see how the long the black holds up. We are tall people and have plenty of room up front.  All I want in a new car is leather seats, a sun roof, satellite radio and some get up and go! I like just about everything about the suv but there are a few things that I feel should have been included on a $50,000 plus vehicle.  1. Why isn't back up sensors standard.  I have the camera but it us useless without the alert from a sensor. 2. The 12 V power socket that located inside the center compartment is useless unless you leave your phone inside the thing. My phone won't fit because I have something else there, no space, and the lid won't close over the cord.  I have to use the rear seat plug.  I do love that the electronics are easy to operate.  I used the remote start twice and it worked fine.  I have only had the car one week.  I am still getting use to all the gadgets and trying to figure out what all I have.  The quick start guide is great and helpful although I have yet to figure out why the car sometimes turns off when I place it in park.  I will make an appointment for someone to come out and go over it all in a few weeks as they offer this as a perk.  I am keeping a running list of questions because they are some options that I can't figure out if I have or not.  Overall, I love the F-Pace.

As of this review, I've owned it for 3 months and 3K miles.  Favorite features:  Remote start & climate via phone app, ventilated/cooled seats, lane keep assist, cavernous trunk, auto-high beams.   Things I hate about it:  Auto start/stop engine is so annoying!  Yes, there's a button to disable it, but it should stay disabled until you enable it manually!  The nav system is straight from 2006, and  the climate control is big f'ing mess of buttons.  Such a hassle to use, especially if you live in a place with large temperature swings.  Want to go from 60F to 77F?  You'll have to press that temp button 17 times!  It would've been better to use knobs like in the XJ or F-Type.    Also, for your inconvenience, there's no ""off"" button for the climate on the console.  Nope - you'll have to use the touch screen to navigate to ""Climate"", where there's an ""on/off"" button.  Genius.  The Tailgate doesn't always work properly.  Sometimes it won't open at all when I use the gesture kick, and sometimes it won't close when I push the button on the tailgate, beeping the horn twice.   I'm also not very happy with the noise from the engine.  It makes an unpleasant thrum when driving at low rpm, and doesn't sound anything like an F-type S at high rpm.  Lastly, there's a creaking sound coming from the rear of the car.  At this price range, it's just unacceptable.  Other than these snags, I love it.",4.0,"So happy I could purrrrr.

But, better late than never.

The 380 hp V6 equipped on the S trim is much more power than the average F-Pace driver will need, but does come in handy for short passing roads and highway merging etc. Gas mileage is of some concern especially because the fuel tank can only hold 16.6 gallons of gas. A 4,000 pound SUV with a combined average of 20mpg should be equipped with at least a 17.4 gallon gas tank. Again Im sure Jaguar engineers have a reason for such a small gas tank but I wish they would have made it a bit larger. The In Control Touch Pro infotainment system is amazing based solely on it being a touch screen (I do not believe Mercedes, BMW, Lexus or any other luxury brand comes equipped with touch screens anymore). The Brakes don't seem as powerful as they should be but I still have confidence in them. Overall the F-Pace has been an amazing car so far and has definitely gathered some looks especially when I select neutral and push the gas down and everyone hears the engine pop.

Having to order this SUV without driving the 20D was a bit scary after test driving the 35T--I thought the 180 HP would be underpowered --noisy and lack acceleration especially uphill. Wow--was I ever surprised with my very first diesel. The torque really does all the work effortlessly. It's plenty fast enough. Driving at speeds of 75-82 mpg---with 600 lbs of luggage in the back for 10-14 hours a day--we were getting 35-41mpg--pretty awesome. One time passing a car at 75 mpg the excelartion was so good that in a matter of seconds I was at 96mpg. Coming from Montreal where gas prices are between $4-5/ Gallon--the gas mileage was a factor in buying this car. I have been a Lexus RX and NX SUV owner for 17 years and needed a change-they were getting a little boring and their Navigation is so bad I carried a Garmin at all times--it would take me either the wrong way or out of my way many times--The Jag Navigation system was awesome and even told you to prepare to exit to the right or left --in 2 miles--giving you plenty of time to get in the proper lane--never missed an exit or panicked to get over quickly to exit. The Seats are so comfortable I would say they are equal to the Lexus RX and superior to the smaller NX--NEVER got a sore back or butt even after being in the car for 14 hours. The 14 ways adjustable seats are worth the option. The car handles flawlessly and you feel like you are driving the car with all 4 PAWS on the road--not driving a car that is on top of 4 wheels. I have seen and read almost every review on this car and the few little complaints that came up are non-issues--the window controls are up on top---not an issue--how often do you roll down your windows?? And it would spoil the design of the inside doors--then they would look like every other car.--The Standard Navigation is great  and easy to use--no need to upgrade there. Plus my wife can use it and look for things while we drive where Lexus and many others block you out--(again the need for a Garmin in my Lexus so you don't have to stop) Base stereo at 380 watts is awesome--you don't need 825 watts. Some said the interior plastics looked cheap--I did not see any difference from Jag and the Lexus that would matter--if so--you cant see them anyway-Haven't tried the voice command yet--but I gave up trying with all my Lexus SUV'S --I have 5 of them over the years and none worked.  The driving position is fantastic--you can see the front and sides of the car--this is the only SUV my wife can drive where she can actually see the front and sides--other SUV's--all she saw was glass out the front which makes it more difficult to judge distances when turning or parking.The 20D is very quiet and after driving Lexus for 17 years with quiet and comfort--you do want that in a Luxury car--so I prefer the 20d over the 35T--which is pretty noisy due to its extra power and exhaust system--it does sound sporty and is faster--but if you drive like that you will pay at the pumps and probably get a few extra tickets as well--we don't drive cars like that in the real world anyway---if you do--try the 20D is Dynamic Sports mode--it gives you plenty of pick up and a sporty drive. I do hope this car is as reliable as Lexus was to me--in 17 years and 5 different SUV's with Lexus--I went to the dealer only Once--for a rattle in the roof---that's why I kept buying them---just couldn't put up with their Navigation system with the Mouse and Finger pad---actually was pretty dangerous to use while driving for anything as it controlled stereo and other things---Touch System is the Jaguar I so much easier and faster-- at least your passenger can use it so you can keep your eyes on the road.

Absolutely no technical issues till this day. Vehicle made in Great Britain, engine Great Britain, transmission from Germany. We are in early 40’s, in the garage we also have the 2016 Lexus RX350 made in Canada, and also no majors problems with this vehicle. Wife prefers RX350 because of roomier interior, quieter and softer ride, more luxurious interior feel, high end materials, brave exterior design, best LED headlights in the industry, overall: “women’s car”. l did notice about 80% women are RX’s drivers.I also liked RX350, but absolutely love the F-Pace. Best driving vehicle I have ever owned, pure pleasure on the turns. In my opinion best looking in the segment, handles like a sport sedan due to torque vectoring and sport suspension. Accelerates like another brand's gas V6’s due to turbo charger, and very high torque 318 ft. lbs. Absolutely great all weather performance due to standard Land Rover’s AWD technology (rear axle based!!). Very sensitive steering wheel specially in Sport mode – this vehicle really listens to you and you fully feel the car (Swiss precision). Great navigation system, many great features from 5 year free Jaguar Remote App, panoramic glass roof, large trunk. And absolute segment leader (including Hybrids) 32 mpg city, 38 mpg highway. Very cool movable gear selector knob, and the main thing: British prestige.Yes, there are small issues I did notice: interior should have more high quality (remember, mine is base model...), auto start/stop don’t remember your preferences after engine restart, not too roomie and no reclining rear seats (mine is base...maybe because this is sport not family car),  rear and side visibility not to good, and weak base headlights (mine are not LED), mediocre base sound system, unpainted cheep plastic door handle inside, not very pleasant interior smell (mine is artificial leather, maybe that’s why). Quick conclusion: This vehicle is designed for people who enjoying driving, not for family soft and luxury cruising. It has legendary Land Rover off road roots, and the famous handling from Jaguar's long motor sport history. If you are bored of German or Japanese luxury cars, looking for something not thirsty, unique and prestige, handsome and fresh, sporty performing, handling, steering and accelerating, 5 years free maintenance and 5 years b2b warranty, F-Pace 2.0 Diesel is definitely for you. If you have a family, or looking for softer, quieter and luxurious ride, buy RX350. But please remember one thing: on winding roads driving super comfy RX350 you will be slower at least 30 mph.  And last interesting info I just learned about how “boutique” this brand is: Jaguar sold in the whole USA the same amount of cars as BMW sold just in the Chicagoland in the same period of time. Would you like to drive something unique?

713, on 05/22/17 10:57 AM (PDT),Paul F. ,2014 Jaguar F-TYPE Convertible V8 S 2dr Convertible (5.0L 8cyl S/C 8A),My dream car come true!," If you're looking for a relatively exclusive, classy, fun to drive 2-seater sports car that gets attention without looking like you're having a mid-life crisis, the Jaguar F-Type must be on your shortlist. Especially in V8 configuration, you get Corvette-like performance but with classier styling over the track-focused Corvette and more exclusivity over the other usual offerings from Porsche or BMW with similar performance. The F-Type is downright gorgeous with high quality fit and finish. Its 8-speed auto transmission is fast shifting and fun to drive aggressively (you really won't miss a manual) but the real fun is in the sound; everyone who rides with you will be smiling as much as you! Performance is near supercar status (in V8 guise) with the supercharged 5.0L engine rocketing to 0-60 at just under 4 seconds and a top speed north of 180 mph. The V8S RWD is tail-happy so you do have to make sure you are paying attention coming into high speed corners (newer versions like the AWD R help alleviate some of this). Steering response is smooth and immediate. Despite its performance focused suspension, the car still provides a relatively comfortable ride and getting to speed is just plain fun depending on how you want to drive it; think of the F-Type as a cross between a European-muscle car and GT cruiser. Electronics (especially the infotainment system) lags a little behind newer offerings but then I didn't buy the vehicle for infotainment; the real entertainment is in the driving experience as a whole back by the wonderful exhaust symphony. And, if you're patient, low mileage versions can be found at moderate prices (although that is relative too considering sticker prices are typically near or above six figures for a new one with the V8). If you can, find one with the Performance Pack (better seats, 20-inch wheels, bigger brakes with red calipers, etc.) and Vision Pack with Blind Spot Monitoring (to help with cross traffic, parking, and backing up since visibility over and around the car’s sumptuous curves is limited) along with other packs/upgrades that enhance the ownership, driving experience, and resale value. While long term reliability seems to be much improved offer previous Jaguar offerings, the F-Type is still relatively new so I also recommend investing in an extended warranty that can be purchased from your Jaguar dealership.",5.0,"My dream car come true!

Two weeks ago I flew from Michigan to South Carolina to pick up my brand new 2014  ( yes, I realize the 2016's are coming out very soon ) F-Type Jaguar convertible, V-6 S, in British Racing Green with dark brown leather with light stitching and a black top.  I fit like the car was tailor made just for me.  I can stretch out my left leg fully, the seat holds but does not dig in ( Porsche ), my line of sight is in the middle of the windshield, not at the upper support bar ( Corvette ).  I drove a V-8 S several months ago and fell in love with the car but as hard as it is for a car guy to say, it was too powerful to be fun.  My car can be driven with some gusto and I can enjoy the amazing exhaust sounds without hitting crazy speeds and likely going to jail.  The middle choice in the lineup was the perfect car for me.  Amazing lines, rare color,outstanding build quality and well thought out driving position and dash layout.   Drove my new ""Kitty"" home (830 miles) straight through and I could not get the big smile off my suntanned face.  Got 29.2 mpg if that matters to any potential buyers running 75 to 85 mph.  It took me a long time to finally decide on my special car.  Spending this kind of money should make you think twice. I sometimes call this my anti-Tesla.  There is a great mix of sophisticated aides and functions but enough great old school DNA to make me think that these kinds of cars may not be build forever in an electric, Google computer driver future.   I feel that Jaguar has built a car that will still put a big smile on my face 20 years from now when I press the orange start button and this car roars to life.   You will want to keep the sport exhaust turned ""off"" until you are out of  your neighborhood, trust me.  The trunk is ""soft side"" overnight bags small but this is a weekend or special use car for most owners and the way the lines of the car work so well together I promise you will not care about the small trunk.  Design over function is ""OK"" sometimes.  Could not be happier with my purchase. Note: perhaps in some areas of the country these cars are more plentiful.  Where I live they are ""Blue Moon"" rare.  Be prepared for lot's of attention.A year later and no issues at all.  The more I drive my Jag the more that I appreciate the build quality, the design, and the way this car is sorted out.  We make wonderful drives along the back roads near Lake Michigan visiting the great small  harbor towns with the car and those types of roads are the cars favorite.  Top down driving is something that we thought we would like but actually love.  The sounds and smells along with fantastic views transform a normal ride into an adventure.  One small issue.

Just tinted the windows so it looks bad a** on white. I'll summarize the good and bad I've experienced so far.Pros: According to trip computer averaging a whopping 25.5 mpg in mixed city/hwy driving. Beautiful interior design and aesthetic layout of controls. My first Jag and everything was very intuitive and easy to learn. Very quick and super smooth gear shifts whether in automatic or using manual paddle shifters. Dynamic mode turns this from a civilized luxury sport car to a hilariously fun roaring ""beast"". Trunk space able to fit all road trip essentials including full size cooler and more. Once you find a good fit the sport seats provide excellent support and fits like a glove. Lovely safety features of the Vision Pack (e.g. blind spot monitor, rear camera, front and rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic warning, etc.). Security knowing it's covered by Jaguar's ""Best in Class"" 5 yr./60k mi. warranty, scheduled service, and roadside assist.

Still in love and yes, extremely fun to drive! Just tinted the windows so it looks bad a** on white. I'll summarize the good and bad I've experienced so far.Pros: According to trip computer averaging a whopping 25.5 mpg in mixed city/hwy driving. Beautiful interior design and aesthetic layout of controls. My first Jag and everything was very intuitive and easy to learn. Very quick and super smooth gear shifts whether in automatic or using manual paddle shifters. Dynamic mode turns this from a civilized luxury sport car to a hilariously fun roaring ""beast"". Trunk space able to fit all road trip essentials including full size cooler and more. Once you find a good fit the sport seats provide excellent support and fits like a glove. Lovely safety features of the Vision Pack (e.g. blind spot monitor, rear camera, front and rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic warning, etc.). Security knowing it's covered by Jaguar's ""Best in Class"" 5 yr./60k mi. warranty, scheduled service, and roadside assist.

729, on 08/10/18 12:26 PM (PDT),Alex Dimitriu ,2016 Jaguar F-TYPE Convertible S 2dr Convertible (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),STAY AWAY from Jaguar Land Rover products!!," Let me start by saying that this is probably one of a handful of reviews I have ever posted anywhere on the Internet. Previous cars and trade in. Reasons why.So I have two Jaguar cars. Both 2016 models, one is a XF 35T, and another is an F Type S with automatic transmission and RWD. The cars are stunning on the outside when you compare them with just about anything on the road, south of $150K. As far as interiors go, the F Type I have is fully loaded with their sport seats and extended leather package. It smells great inside, like a leather factory, and the seats and sitting position is spot on for my 6.0’ height. The XF on the other hand has a very plain and unremarkable interior, and I have the version with the vinyl seats, which are horrible and feel like you are sitting on bubble wrap.The infotainment systems on both cars are really crappy when comparing with all major competitors, and even with Jeep or Nissan systems.For the XF we traded in a twelve year old E Class. That car had a more buttoned up interior and nicer overall trim but it was time for a change. BTW it had zero major issues outside of maintenance, some front end ball joints, a fuel tank sender and a brake module (this last one was an expensive repair).As far as the F Type, a 2013 5 Series was traded at 29K miles. That car was completely trouble free. Previous dealer experienceWhen serviced at BMW of Darien in CT, everything was covered, brake pads, tires, wiper blades. The infotainment in the BMW is LEAGUES ABOVE the Jaguar unit, although it was three years older.Mercedes Benz always provided a loaner on the spot, even when they were repairing a ten-year-old car. They really are on point, the dealer always followed up, and the in / out time when bringing in for service can be counted in minutes.Local Jaguar DealerThis local dealer has to be one of their worst dealers although that would be tough to flesh out. When they serviced the XF they left the engine cover just loosely thrown on top of the engine, not pinned down. When the tires got bubbles on the side walls at 12K miles, the dealer said it’s not covered, and the Jaguar Land Rover North America call center pretty much said the same thing, and said you’re on your own. Luckily Good Year the tire manufacturer that Jaguar chose as a supplier, gave us a small credit towards the purchase of three new tires. Now we have a car with one older tire, and the same brand and model installed that previously failed because of supposed pot holes. The same roads and pot holes were driven through by me in my previous Porsche 911 with 305 cross section Pirelli tires that never had a side wall issue.When I brought the f Type for service they said the free included oil change would not be covered this time. They wanted $190 for oil and filter (7 quarts synthetic and a filter).  They said I went over 30 days past the two year mark of the cars’ in service date of June 1st 2016. So, they did the oil change last year (Jaguar Land Rover Freeport) so they knew when the year was up. The car’s computer warned me two weeks ago, and the app on my phone (Jaguar In Control) did the same. We never received any emails or calls from either the dealer or Jaguar Land Rover that the service was due. I proceeded to make the call for service and was told to come in the following week on a Tuesday morning. They also said that no loaners were available but I can wait for 1.5 hours and they would service and wash the car. When I found out about the oil change fee, I refused that service, but mentioned some trim fitting problem in the interior. After waiting in their waiting room for 1.5 hours, they said that a seat would need to come out and they will schedule me to come back a different time. But to sit tight and the service advisor would return with a date and time. Thirty minutes later he returned with a receipt for $0 that also mentioned some 27 point courtesy inspection. No mention of what that entails, and the Jaguar Call Center could not verify either. So I waited two hours there and nothing was done. Not even the follow up appointment. The SERVICE advisor said call next week to get a date to come back, and pointed to my car and said –“ exit is that way”. When I got home I noticed that one of the wipers had broken pieces of rubber hanging out of it. Apparently the 27 point inspection does not include looking at the wiper blades.Selling at a lossI am so angry that all financial rationale is out the window at this point. All major losses on a new car happen the first year or two, and the F Type has 11K mikes on it  now. I was planning on keeping it until the warranty expires, but no way I am doing that now. Found a six month old Porsche 911 dealer demo with Certified Pre Owned. Much better dealer network and cars. They will probably kill me on this trade in, but in all honesty I can’t really blame them.

732, on 02/20/16 19:04 PM (PST),Mike Marshall ,1999 Jaguar XJ-Series Sedan XJ8 4dr Sedan,Stand out in the Crowd but get credit card ready!," If you can't afford to drive a $70K car then don't and this applies to used/older ones. I'm 55, a car nut since a kid and  buy cars based on looks but that can be expensive. If you want reliability you'll have to buy an ugly Japanese car but if you want something ""cool"" well this Red 1999 Jaguar XJ8 with chrome wheels is gorgeous BUT buy one from someone else who has already spent thousands of dollars on the many repairs that come with ""being cool"". I bought this car around 2012 from Orig owner with 61K miles in San Diego in show room condition but was APPALLED  to see all of the repair receipts from the original owner on a car with only 61K miles. The receipts totaled well over $12,000 and YES you will replace those plastic timing belt tensioners (orig. owner paid for that thankfully!) The only reason I bought this is because I'm retired so don't drive much and have only  put 5,000 miles on it and hoping for now more expensive repairs but have had one of the 8 expensive coils replaced, windshield wiper reservoir leaks, oil pan gasket just replaced, smog issue fixed. Potential head gasket leak as of now. Front shock blown. All that in Just the 5000 miles that I've driven it. SO on the positive side, it is a classic beautiful car, drives and handles like a Corvette, great power esp. when sport mode is set. Quiet and nice to drive, took it  up to 110 mph thru Camp Pendleton one night late with no traffic around and was quiet, felt safe, stable, solid and was very impressed. Interior is nice quality except cheap cup holders and no storage space. Tight back seat on this short wheel base model. If I bought one again I'd def. have gotten the XJR after seeing the almost 400Hp and foot lbs of torque and 0-60 in 5.2 seconds  (better than my former 1999 Mercedes S600 V-12 by a full second!) Those are even worse in reliability/repairs (NEVER touch a Mercedes built after 1991!)  So, like anything in life, ""you get  what you paid for"" and got a great buy at only $5000 BUT can see why these cars are so cheap because of terrible reliability but will enjoy occasionally driving it and it gets TONS of compliments from both old and young people as it really stands out on the road. Ford improved it in 1997 but would not recommend this car to anyone on a ""budget"" as ""it pay$ to be cool"" but for $5K in this mint condition I do love the car and I've owned 60+cars. Remember, if you buy...........look for orig owner WITH ALL REPAIR RECEIPTS AND MAKE SURE TENSIONERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED AS IT IS ""DNA"" DEFECT AND WILL COST YOU SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR. The last receipt I got from the old guy/orig owner was for $4900 for misc stuff that should NOT break! **My mechanic says best to get a 2000+model as it works better with the newer computer analytic repair tools that mechanics use.  Also, helpful hint, if your message center comes up with ""Stability control/ABS"" not working, don't automatically assume you need the expensive main computer module, mechanic says each 4 wheels has a single monitor and even just one going out will give out this message BUT way cheaper to replace just the 1 or 2 individual wheel sensors VS main computer module which may NOT be the problem. Also just disconnecting the battery to ""reset"" it works often. As mentioned, electronic issues are one of the main problems on these cars. ON the good side, car saved my life when I swerved harder than I ever have to avoid a car of the freeway that cut out of bumper to bumper traffic right in front of me as I was going by at approx 50mph, this Jag handled like a ""go cart"" and handled beautifully and went right around that car with no squeeling, leaning, rolling over.

737, on 06/11/09 22:06 PM (PDT),phil ,1999 Jaguar XJ-Series Sedan XJ8 4dr Sedan,A perfect beast," After a little over 5 months with this car I can say that my 1999 Jaguar XJ8 is the best car I've ever owned. I was lucky enough to get a one owner, dealer serviced car that was owned by a single male. The back seat was never even sat in.

For the money they are the most luxurious, best handling, greatest looking, and distinctive luxury cars on the planet.  The 2004+ models were the result of over a billion dollars spent by FORD in improvements to the Jaguar range.  These cars are never mistaken for anything but a Jaguar.  I have owned two of the 2004 models (and drive one currently) and they both provide outstanding handling, value, and the kind of driving experience that gets your heart beating when you turn the key.  As far as I'm concerned, when friends ask me if I like my Jaguar luxury/performance car, I just say there is NO OTHER CAR.  I just can't say enough about the experience of owning a Jaguar.  It is a singular pleasure unmatched in the motoring world.  Update:  Two years later not a single problem.  Car is a dream.  Buy one.  Update after two years:  Car is fantastic.  Still no issues whatsoever.  Only maintenance is changing fluids.  The 2004-2009 Jaguar XJ8 (350) are the last, repeat last, of the traditional Jaguars in terms of styling and traditional luxury interiors.  I'm convinced these cars will or are becoming modern classics.  A 3004-2006 with under 45000 miles can still be had for under $15k and probably will never depreciate any lower than that.

I chose the coupe over the convertible because quite frankly it has a much better ass.  The convertible is fine if you live in south Florida and have an enlarged prostate, but it just lacks the appeal of the coupe.  This is a true GT give speed and comfort, with a decent amount of rigidity and stability with traction control on.  If you want a wild ride, hold the traction control button for 10 seconds to disengage the control and go easy in the first curve!!!  Acceleration is amazingly quick.  The paddle shift is instantaneous. The huge front discs provide more than adequate braking without any signs of fade, any the new rigid all aluminum frame keeps everything feeling taut.  The interior has the classic Jaguar burled wood and plush supportive leather seats which can be adjusted 12 different way from Sunday to fit most any height and stature.  The back seat, while looking nice serves no real practical purpose.  Space is so limited you couldn't fit a legless dwarf back there.  The coupe does have a usable trunk which will fit a couple of full size luggage or 2 sets of golf clubs.  There are a few things to be concerned with on this vehicle.  They are known to have sticky thermostats which are not difficult to change out yourself.  Mine would generally stick in colder weather if the car wasn't warmed up for a few minutes before taking it out.  This demonstrated a dashboard warning.  After speaking to the dealer he told me to just buy an error code scanner and eliminate the code if it comes up repeatedly.  Also, be careful not to leave this car out in the sun as a habit.  The dashboard leather will shrink and start to pull away!!!  Get a dashboard cover or reflector.  There is no easy fix for this. Your looking at a close to $4000 repair (to have it done right).  All in all this is a fantastic car which was designed by the same person who designed the Aston Martin DB7-9.

Lucky me because this happened at 49k miles and it has a 4 year/50k mile warranty. The dealership stood by Jaguar's warranty and helped me. It took 3 trips to the dealer to get it fixed. They ended up replacing the coolant reservoir the first time, the Y pipe the second time, and the 3rd try was the charm having replaced a hose that was leaking. Although frustrating to have those issues and keep having to go back to the dealer, the actual dealership was great to work with and ended up getting it resolved, they gave me a loaner car 2 of the 3 times. That is the type of issue that can happen to any car so I'm not knocking the vehicle TOO much there. The exclusivity, looks, style, used value, etc. on this car are pretty unbeatable.

Car is great to drive, great to be seen in, comfortable seats, great sound system on the portfolio trim. The brisk, effortless acceleration from the v8 delivers lots of laughs and is high on the giggle meter. Preventative Maintenance costs aren't TOO bad as long as you avoid the dealer for that, I got a full synthetic oil change, fluids topped off, fuel injectors cleaned, 4 wheel-alignment, flat tire repair, different tire installed, and 2 air filters replaced all for $245.  1 problem is the interior build quality has developed a squeak/rattle.

Stunning looks & style for a SUV, well laid out & comfortable sporty cockpit (F Type copy), good driver visibility, brilliant performance technology, great features, smooth quick-shifting nine-speed transmission, quite nimble, precise steering, super stable braking, great cornering & windy conditions stability, excellent surround camera system, brilliant adaptive cruise control, unbelievable self parking, very good sound system, good interior fit and finish, and great storage capability considering vehicle size. Cons: Little expensive, feathery overly sensitive accelerator pedal (spurts), washed out touchscreen display, windshield blocks radio frequencies, and a few other minor issues listed under, “Details of Issues”.Overall: A vehicle well suited to city driving and equally at home in the country; but not my first choice for long distance trips (full-size SUV time). The vehicle is best suited to a family of four or less (children and smaller bodies in the rear). The 21 inch wheels provide a great ride in “Comfort” & “Dynamic” modes, better than the smaller offerings. Brakes are excellent and feel stable under hard braking. Has “ECO” mode to improve fuel consumption. 6 -different models and a plethora of options to suit most needs. Has all the latest safety features and collision avoidance. Top model could do with a more powerful motor. It is miles better than the competition.5 out of 5 if it wasn’t for the touchscreen display washout and the feathery throttle pedal. Bottom Line: If you want the best looking, best handling compact SUV in the world, your search stops here.Details of Issues (nothing major)ExpensiveHas better performance technology than the competition which costs a little more; but even so, still seems a bit pricey.Windshield Blocks Radio FrequenciesThe windshield is metalized resulting in the blocking of radio frequencies. There is a small clear patch to place your Toll Tag. So the range of wireless devices will be reduced (up to 95%), including; door and gate openers, phones, RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and medical alert. Feather Light and Overly Sensitive Throttle PedalAlmost no foot feel and too sensitive. A bumpy road, a sharp corner or just acceleration forces can cause unwanted acceleration spurts (jerking). Also, you have to hold your foot up all the time when just cruising. It feels unnatural and a little uncomfortable. Thank goodness for the excellent adaptive cruise control. Touchscreen WashoutThe touchscreen difficult to see in bright daylight and is barely visible in bright sunny conditions. The problem is that the display sits angled almost flat well ahead of the roofline and there is no sunshade, so the sun shines right on it. Accentuated by no high contrast color scheme option, just “Light” (light pastel) or “Dark”. It’s fine at night or on dreary days.Windshield Reduces Night VisionThe windshield is metalized to block UV rays which it does well. It also cuts down visible light reducing normal vision just like sunglasses or regular window tint does. The problem is that it also reduces vision at night too when you need maximum clarity. Road NoiseRoad (tire) noise is noticeable and could benefit from improved floor and wheel arch insulation.Automatic Relocking & ArmingOnly the dealership can turn it on or off. I can see the reason for automatic locking and arming in high crime areas. In the country, the automatic system is annoying and inconvenient. There should be an easy way to turn the feature on and off.Door Locked Condition IndicatorNo visible external indicator that the doors are locked (except the folding door mirrors). In a noisy bright light situation, it’s difficult to see (light flash) or hear the doors lock. Automatic Power Fold Door MirrorsUseful option, but it can only be turned on and off by the dealership? Keyless Door LockingKeyless locking is overly complicated and imprecise (Unlocking is great). The manual goes into detail not to grab the door handle while touching the lock sensor. In reality, it is only necessary to be lightly touching the handle for the sensor not to work; or if your finger touches a little outside of the sensor area. One could turn on the auto locking full time, but that causes other irritating convenience issues.Restricted Driver’s Foot WellNo good place to put your left foot if you have long legs. Wheel well intrudes into this space. I guess people with long legs shouldn’t drive compact SUVs on long trips.Reflections from Bright Shiny BezelsReflection in driver’s side mirror from bright shiny driver’s side air vent bezel. Can be a distraction. Reflections from bright shiny bezels (air vents and display) on front windshield.Driver’s Maximum Seat HeightThe front dash and side windows sills are quite high. I found that with the seat all the way up, I still felt like I was sitting a bit too low (1 inch).",4.0,"Best Compact SUV by a mile; simply outstanding Pros: Best looking, best handling in class and fun to drive. Stunning looks & style for a SUV, well laid out & comfortable sporty cockpit (F Type copy), good driver visibility, brilliant performance technology, great features, smooth quick-shifting nine-speed transmission, quite nimble, precise steering, super stable braking, great cornering & windy conditions stability, excellent surround camera system, brilliant adaptive cruise control, unbelievable self parking, very good sound system, good interior fit and finish, and great storage capability considering vehicle size. Cons: Little expensive, feathery overly sensitive accelerator pedal (spurts), washed out touchscreen display, windshield blocks radio frequencies, and a few other minor issues listed under, “Details of Issues”.Overall: A vehicle well suited to city driving and equally at home in the country; but not my first choice for long distance trips (full-size SUV time). The vehicle is best suited to a family of four or less (children and smaller bodies in the rear). The 21 inch wheels provide a great ride in “Comfort” & “Dynamic” modes, better than the smaller offerings. Brakes are excellent and feel stable under hard braking. Has “ECO” mode to improve fuel consumption. 6 -different models and a plethora of options to suit most needs. Has all the latest safety features and collision avoidance. Top model could do with a more powerful motor. It is miles better than the competition.5 out of 5 if it wasn’t for the touchscreen display washout and the feathery throttle pedal.
