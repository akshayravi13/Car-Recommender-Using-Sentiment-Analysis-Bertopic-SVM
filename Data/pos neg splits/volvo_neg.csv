 on 02/11/18 14:08 PM (PST),andy ,2006 Volvo S60 Sedan 2.5T 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),"Good performance, bad steering"," This car looks great and performs great. The turbo gives a good boost of power for merging. The steering radius isn't awful but isn't good. You need to get used to having to turn the wheel more if you are transitioning from another car. It isn't terrible for making turns, etc., but for avoiding potholes and such you will need to jerk your wheel more. It isn't instant response like expected. The interior feels pretty high quality. It rattles a bit in my car and some carpeting on the front pillars are peeling off, but I attribute that to the age. There are strange decisions like how the back seats don't have door pockets, and the anti whiplash headrests for the front seats are too tall to give backseat passengers a good view out the front which is lame. There is little backseat legroom, but it's not absolutely awful. There are interesting features like auto folding back headrests, and an additional two cupholders if you unlatch the cupholder part of the center console (that's 2 cupholders in front + 2 extra cupholders in front + 2 in rear). There is some cheapness like if your model does not come with foglamps, the buttons are still there and there are cutouts for fog lamps on the outside which are empty. The controls could be less confusing. The radio is just unnecessarily complex and climate controls are unnecessarily complex, but once you figure them out it isn't too bad. I don't like how there is no knob to adjust radio stations, just an auto scan button. The volume knob on my vehicle is broken, but the steering wheel has them built in which is nice. Still surprising it broke. The non-premium sound system sucks. There is barely any base or clarity, and my 18 year old Buick Century's stereo was 4x better with stock stereo (until it blew). Very disappointing. The leather seats are really comfortable and you get a lot of adjustments including lumbar support for front, and they don't look too bad for the age (just a few aesthetic cracks). I don't understand how the trunk really works. Sometimes pressing on the handle to unlatch the trunk works, sometimes it doesn't. I do not like how when you unlock the car it doesn't flash the lights. The key fob will work from afar but you can never tell if it really unlocked, but it has a neat remote light activation feature. The headlights will turn off if the car is off regardless of the knob position, and can't be manually turned back on as far as I can tell. Only the high beams work when off. It isn't a big deal, but it's a strange decision. The headlights/tail lights should stay on and turn off automatically after a few minutes for safety in my opinion. The glovebox is too small, and the center console storage is deep but not long enough. The wiper controls don't make a ton of sense. You have several positions for the wiper stalk, custom speed position where you use the knob to adjust speed, low speed preset position, and high speed preset position. It appears to make sense once you learn it, but the custom speed position sets a max wiper speed and you must use the low speed or high speed preset if you need it faster than what the wiper speed is when the knob is turned as far as it can go. I don't like how the windshields are designed. They are ""set into"" the car. That is, they have a raised border on the left and right edges, so removing snow is a pain because the snow gets stuck on the edges. The door handles are the old design and can freeze, although the doors on this car are pretty well designed because they don't really freeze. I do not like how the access door to the trunk from the backseat is designed. The release button for the trunk access door is in the trunk, and it opens into the rear seat instead of into the trunk, covering the armrest when it is down. And if you need to close the armrest, you need to close the trunk access door too and you can't unlatch it again without going into the trunk. The trunk has pretty good space, by the way. For a car all about safety, I'm surprised foglights, tire pressure sensors, and stability control aren't standard, although there is a plethora of air bags and neat anti-whiplash front seats. By the way, the car is pretty safe, although it is not as safe in side impacts as some other non-safety-centric cars of the same era ironically.

I sort of bought this car because I was getting reading to take a winter road trip to Montana and wanted something with AWD.  I would have preferred an XC-70, but couldn't find one for the right price or in the time I allotted myself.  I ended up seeing my S60 for sale at the local BMW dealership for $6995 with 102,000 miles.  It was a one-owner vehicle purchased from and always serviced on time at the local Volvo dealership in town.  After taxes and fees I think I ended up spending more than $8K, which in retrospect was way too high.  I did, however, end up getting new tires (Michelin all seasons) right away, the old ones were ""ok,"" but not great, some sheep skin seat covers (some of the stitching split on the driver's side seat), and some OEM Volvo all-weather floor mats (all worthwhile investments).  So the car, it's much smoother than my old wagon, great acceleration despite the additional 600lbs of the Haldex AWD system, decent gas mileage and road handling.  Like all Volvos, the seats are supremely comfortable--second-to-none!  My car's trial by fire was a 900+ mile road trip to  Montana in December amid regular blizzards and arctic temperatures.  My gas mileage was pretty decent over 28mpg at over 80mph most of the time.  As with most vehicle, it handles really poorly on ice, it does however, do great in the snow.  Once those back wheels start to grip, the thing can go almost anywhere (within reason).  I did find out at the dealership during my last service that my control arm bushings are bad, so that might account for some of the sketchiness on the ice and just the freeway in general.  Much to my surprise yet again, the A/C and heating systems are some of the best I've encountered!  Some of the other reviews have mentioned the cramped nature of the backseats, that is true, it's very tight with a full-size adult sitting back there.  The trunk while spacious has a fairly narrow opening which makes it a difficult to put some things in.  I have a wheeled cooler that I like to take to the beach which often has to sit on the backseat rather than in the trunk.  It fits fine in my wife's 2007 Jetta, but that has a higher and wider trunk I guess.  Overall, I don't have a lot of gripes with this car.  I enjoy driving it and it's a nice looking vehicle.  One of my biggest concerns though is the creeps, groans, and clunks I was experiencing over the winter.  Anytime I would go over uneven pavement or speed humps the car made some weird noises from the front end.  Maybe it's some back chassis bushings, maybe it is the control arms, or it could even be the struts?  All I know is it makes me apprehensive when it happens.  It's been great over the summer though, no issues like that whatsoever.  I can foresee this car treating me well for the foreseeable future.  Will it be as good as my old V-70?

So far we are very pleased with our choice.  Getting to consider the Volvo was due primarily to the very positive experience we had with the dealer group (Fields Automotive) while we owned our 2005 Infiniti G35 sedan.  That was a great car, but we were not enthused about staying with Infiniti (great driving experience, but expensive operating and maintenance costs).  Same group had a Volvo store and decided to check it out.  First impressions: clean design, interior and exterior (typical Euro/Scandinavian functionalistic, without being cold);  good driving experience: totally surprised by throttle response from the T5 engine, handling; visibility, and  comfort. Also appreciated that the tech interface was not the centerpiece of the dashboard like most new cars.  Good combination of actual buttons and knobs with screen controls.  Has a screen saver option, so the display goes dark after 20 seconds, instead of staring at you.  Looked at an Acura TLX 2.0 4-cyl (poor engine response, dash is way too busy) and a Lexus ES (nice car, still a Camry, and pricey).   So we went with the S60 (thought about the V60, but didn't need the extra room, and the sedan was a bit quieter).We've only had it 4 months, but still very pleased. Good on the highway: plenty of power even at speed, quiet: some road noise, but not obtrusive.  City driving is relaxed.  Auto Stop/Start is a little weird at first, but you get used to it.  BLIS is great.   Back seat (which has been described as tight) has been totally comfortable for 2 adults.  Trunk has also been adequate for our needs.  Great gas mileage: 25/35 (which is tremendous coming from about 16 mpg on a good day). Only issue was the electric defrost built into the windshield, which comes with the Climate package.

I purchased it a little over a month ago and so far haven't regretted it at all. I should be clear that the 'R' moniker for the 2004-2007 S60 series vehicles indicated a very different kind car than all of the non-'R' variants. So if you are looking for a review of any S60 model that doesn't have the 'R' badge, you can stop reading and move on to the next review. A significantly re-worked 300HP 5-cylinder engine, sport exhaust, electronically-controlled suspension, Brembo performance disc brakes, and AWD give the S60R a completely different driving character than its siblings. It's quick, nimble, and produces an angry snarl--not too loud or thrashy-- when the tachometer goes over 2k RPM. In terms of styling, the P2 S60's are admittedly divisive. People seem to like it or hate it. I like it. Fortunately, Volvo didn't go overboard with plastic cladding and spoilers on the 'R' models, adding a slightly different front and rear fascia, subtle 'R' badge on the front black cube grille and rear trunk lid, and great-looking 17"" 5-spoke alloy wheels. I love the fact that other than the wheels, the car looks a lot like any other S60. It's a classic factory hot rod that looks like a 'sleeper'. The interior is also a step above other S60's, with premium leather sport seats that are amazingly comfortable, and classy real aluminum trim on the doors and center stack. The two things that I love most about the 'R' interior are the subtle contrasting blue stitching on the black areas of the door panels, handbrake, shifter boot, steering wheel, and dashboard and the metallic blue instrument dials. Classy! However, let's just say up front that the downside of the 'R' badge arrives with certain kinds of repair bills. Those 4-piston Brembo brakes are unique to the 'R', and definitely not cheap to replace. Neither is the big KKK turbocharger. Or the electronically-controlled struts. But if you take care of the car, those kinds of $$$ repairs don't come often. Now, I freely admit that the S60R is no BMW M3 in terms of overall performance, but I love it precisely because it's NOT a BMW M3. Nobody expects a pre-Polestar era Volvo to have a sporty character, but this one does, along with the safety and build quality that Volvo is famous for.

Fun to drive and pretty good economy but it requires Midgrade (89 octane).   The issues thus far after 1 month are mostly annoyances rather than problems. Navigation does not seem to update traffic or construction. Dual-zone climate controls have no sync option. Exterior door handles are pinchy (watch your fingers or you'll be sorry).  The AT&T Wi-if is almost useless and difficult to setup with very, very slow speeds.  The menu system is NOT intuitive and to make matters worse, the manual is not applicable to the actual options in the menu system (e.g. There is no ""My car"" category in the menu system, which is frequently referenced in the manual).  The visors are not extendible so you have no way to block sunlight coming through the side windows (heck, even cheap Fords offer this).  The tire pressure system only tells you if you have a low tire.  No specific info as to which tire is the problem or how low it is.

 on 07/13/15 20:22 PM (PDT),T Nowlin ,2012 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6A),Bought back by dealer for major warranty issues," Update: The vehicle was bought back by Volvo under the CPO warranty at approximately 67,000 miles because of the concerning oil consumption issue they could not resolve after many visits and about six weeks with my car sitting at the shop waiting for a backordered replacement engine. After much consideration, I replaced the vehicle with an equivalent 2014 model, which is the first year of a minor design refresh. This model has been considerably more reliable in all respects. I cannot recommend the 2012 based on the numerous quality issues and the oil consumption problem that was specific to very early second-generation S60s. Original review: I have owned nothing but Volvos. That said, I'm a bit of a car guy and know the comparisons between my 2012 S60 T5 and its competitors. While it may not handle as tightly as a comparable Mercedes or BMW, a T5 beats a base 3-series or C-Class hands-down when it comes to speed and comfort. It's also a sharp-looking car. My primary motivation for purchasing this vehicle was because it was the second safest car ever tested by the IIHS (next to the Tesla Model S) at the time. I bought it certified pre-owned from a Volvo dealer with about 30,000 miles in 2014. It has the premium package (sunroof, leather, power passenger seat) and climate package (heated seats, headlight washers, rain-sensing wipers). The draw to the CPO car was the 100,000-mile/7-year drivetrain warranty. While I adore this car, I am also very, very glad I have the extended warranty. I don't think I've ever had to take a car into the shop so often. At the time I'm writing this, I have taken the car in four times to fix a leak in the passenger floorboard that they cannot identify (I will give the dealer credit for their exhaustive efforts with this). The silver trim on the steering wheel and console began to peel, which they replaced. They also replaced a broken air vent. One leather panel on the backseat has begun to flake while the ones beside of it have not. It's obvious to me that the tiny panel in the middle is made of inferior material to those surrounding it. The dealer would not address this because they ""found evidence"" that my dog had ridden in the backseat. Most problematic is that the oil pressure warning came on 4,000 miles after my most recent service, meaning that it was four (of five) quarts low. It goes in later this week to have that issue figured out. I maintain this car well, having my services done when (or before) they're due, and only use synthetic oil. It shouldn't be having these problems. But most importantly to me, I'm safe, comfortable, have the power to escape a treacherous situation, and look damn good doing it. But, of course, it is as I'm on my way to the dealership for the millionth time for warranty work.",3.0,"Bought back by dealer for major warranty issues Update: The vehicle was bought back by Volvo under the CPO warranty at approximately 67,000 miles because of the concerning oil consumption issue they could not resolve after many visits and about six weeks with my car sitting at the shop waiting for a backordered replacement engine. After much consideration, I replaced the vehicle with an equivalent 2014 model, which is the first year of a minor design refresh. This model has been considerably more reliable in all respects. I cannot recommend the 2012 based on the numerous quality issues and the oil consumption problem that was specific to very early second-generation S60s.

First, let me state that I have no need for any of the common bells and whistles that manufacturers have been adding to vehicles these days such as lane departure warnings, park assist, even navigation.  This review does not evaluate those areas because quite frankly I don't care about them or use them.  I'm motivated by the following:  how does the car drive, how does the car look, does the car meet my interior/storage needs and how reliable is the car?  That's it.  With that in mind, let's get started.  I narrowed the field down to the Audi S4, Lexus IS350 and the Volvo S60-T6 since all had similar performance specs like 300 HP and AWD as well as identical 0-60 times.   In terms of pure driving performance and sex appeal, the S4 and IS350 win without question.  I'd put the IS350 as the champ.  However, after many test drives I came to realize that 90-95% of the performance those cars offer can be found in the S60-T6 for only 70% of the price.  In other areas such as rear passenger area & trunk space, the S60 was the winner.  I've only owned this car for 30 days so I can't speak to the reliability yet, but I'm expecting industry-standard costs.  One of the things I've noticed is that it's not as smooth in Sport mode both in up/down shifting as the others, but in regular drive mode it's fine.  Aside from that, it's a joy to drive and at a fraction of the cost of it's peers.  And even though I didn't need a luxurious leather seat, it truly is like sinking into a Lay-Z-Boy recliner--amazing.  Bottom line: if you're looking for best in class regardless of price, look to Audi or Lexus and expect to pay $7k-$10k more.  If you want the best interior comfort & space, equal acceleration, 95% driving dynamics and 90% sex appeal for 70% of cost compared to rivals, the S60-T6 is the choice to make.

The interior and exterior style is one of the best in its class; the Audi A6 feels uninspired, the BMW 5 series is just basic, only the Mercedes E class might be able to hold a candle to the S90. Hereâs what I love about the car:1.	Design is absolutely incredible. 2.	B&W sound system is incredible!3.	iPad-like infotainment system is intuitive and awesome4.	Safety systems. I can never go back. The Auto-pilot, adaptive cruise, lane keep, collision detection all work as advertised and are amazing.5.	Heads up display (HUD) is a cool trick! I thought it was gimmicky but now love it.6.	AWD performance in rain is incredible. On snowâ¦ not so much, but I blame the tires not the car.7.	Heated/cooled seats 8.	The diving profiles really change the characteristics of the car.9.	Ability to send the car destinationsMy issues with the car: 1.	Fit and finish. The car has excessive squeaks, rattles, and road noise for a car with this price tag. I was caught up in the moment when during the test drive, but now after a couple of months, I need to drive with the music playing in order to enjoy the car and drown out the squeaks coming from the door seals and plastic bits. The road noise is also incredibly intrusive on Oregon/Washington pot-hole and crack-laden roads and highways. The luxury feel is compromised by the noise which is really unfortunate. 2.	My second issue is with the front seats. The seats use a wire springs to support the driver. Unfortunately there are also some hard metal support beams that provide structure and rigidity to the thigh and leg support portions of the seat. Under the weight of the driver, these support 'beams' dig into your leg and thigh. No amount of adjusting will prevent this. Volvo should have used higher density foam or a full metal support under the seat to prevent the driverâs weight from compressing the foam and causing the support to dig into the drivers legs. Again, I must have been caught up in the moment of the test drive, because I didn't notice this until after I took the car home. So I'm relegated to using a donuts or foam cushion for long-hauls. 3.	Opportunity number three. The infotainment system is ever so slightly under powered. It takes a lot of time for it to boot up. Thankfully the instrument cluster starts up right away. 4.	Four, certain items need to be turned off every driving session. For example, the auto high beams, the auto start/stop, or my preferred driver setting -- I need to turn these on/off every time I start the car. Other manufactures got this right. For example, BMW let customers change the default setting for auto start/stop to remember the last selected setting. I WISH Volvo would do that.5.	A/C has a tendency to kick into high gear randomly and it becomes really loud. Youâre forced to turn it off if you are on a call. I think the problem is with the logic for the auto climate particularly when you have the 2nd row turned on. Itâs as if the system was trying to compensate for the temperature differential and justâ¦ overcompensates.6.	General reliability: Since taking ownership in February, Iâve gone to the dealership 4 times (Iâm writing this review in April). Issues ranging from recall notices (for leaking A/C lines and trim pieces fall off) to excessive condensation in the headlights (which still isnât fixed even after new headlights) and a bunch of software issues. Iâll be scheduling a new visit to the dealership soon for break-related issues.7.	Wifi hotspot stopped working. Maybe because of my trial ending, but It stopped about week 2.8.	The on call app is a bit limited in its utility. At this point itâs not worth paying for after the trial period ends.9.	One last minor gripe. The manual claims that there is a power rear sunshade. I beg to differ. Found no mention of it being an option.Overall, the car is soooo close to being perfect. My biggest concerns are with the rattling noises, uncomfortable seats, and with general software issues. I really wish I didnât have to have a routine of turning on/off my settings every time I turn on the car.

Ladies -- sick of your purse flying around on the passenger's side while you drive? No worries, there's a hook for that, and more shopping bag hooks in the cargo area to keep bags from rolling around with their contents. The car is nearly silent on your average road. Just the slight hum of acceleration, but there is remarkably little wind or road noise, even on the bumpiest, loudest roads. In fact, people I talk to on the phone joke that they know exactly when I'm maneuvering the car because they can hear things that are normally hidden by the white noise of the engine and road. We found the infotainment system to be very logically designed. It functions very similarly to a smartphone. In fact, the settings quick access buttons on the touchscreen feel very reminiscent of the android pull-down settings menu. After a week, using it feels very natural. My one gripe is that I wish the 360 camera were easier to access quickly. It will appear automatically when it senses I'm parking between two cars, but when I'm pulling into my very tight garage or straight into a parking spot, I have to manually pull it up. Not a big deal -- just takes 2 seconds, but hopefully there will be a shortcut option on future iterations. Auto-park is wonderfully helpful for tight spaces. The upgraded sound system is excellent -- coming from an audiophile. The self-driving features are wonderful for the highway and really serve to reduce fatigue by keeping you in the lane and following the car in front of you at a given distance. We really enjoy the highly customizable driver profiles that can both be programmed to a specific key and overridden through the settings menu. One thing that I found slightly annoying in city traffic was that by default, the auto parking brake enabled at every full stop. This results in a bit of a ""jerking"" when you press the gas pedal, as the brake un-engages and the engine re-starts. I disabled the feature and it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I can certainly see how this feature would be useful for hilly areas where you don't want to roll forward or backwards if you lighten up on the brakes. The back seat has more room than any other car in this class that we test drove. It feels more like a mid-sized SUV in terms of space and seat elevation. After reading a ton of reviews online, I have to say that most reviewers' gripes about this car are really non-issues in the long-run.

Bottom line: It's a really solid, well-designed car that's a lot of fun to drive and handle.",5.0,"Incredible sporty SUV Volvo really thought of everything for this car. Ladies -- sick of your purse flying around on the passenger's side while you drive? No worries, there's a hook for that, and more shopping bag hooks in the cargo area to keep bags from rolling around with their contents. The car is nearly silent on your average road. Just the slight hum of acceleration, but there is remarkably little wind or road noise, even on the bumpiest, loudest roads. In fact, people I talk to on the phone joke that they know exactly when I'm maneuvering the car because they can hear things that are normally hidden by the white noise of the engine and road. We found the infotainment system to be very logically designed. It functions very similarly to a smartphone. In fact, the settings quick access buttons on the touchscreen feel very reminiscent of the android pull-down settings menu. After a week, using it feels very natural. My one gripe is that I wish the 360 camera were easier to access quickly. It will appear automatically when it senses I'm parking between two cars, but when I'm pulling into my very tight garage or straight into a parking spot, I have to manually pull it up. Not a big deal -- just takes 2 seconds, but hopefully there will be a shortcut option on future iterations. Auto-park is wonderfully helpful for tight spaces. The upgraded sound system is excellent -- coming from an audiophile. The self-driving features are wonderful for the highway and really serve to reduce fatigue by keeping you in the lane and following the car in front of you at a given distance. We really enjoy the highly customizable driver profiles that can both be programmed to a specific key and overridden through the settings menu. One thing that I found slightly annoying in city traffic was that by default, the auto parking brake enabled at every full stop. This results in a bit of a ""jerking"" when you press the gas pedal, as the brake un-engages and the engine re-starts. I disabled the feature and it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I can certainly see how this feature would be useful for hilly areas where you don't want to roll forward or backwards if you lighten up on the brakes. The back seat has more room than any other car in this class that we test drove. It feels more like a mid-sized SUV in terms of space and seat elevation. After reading a ton of reviews online, I have to say that most reviewers' gripes about this car are really non-issues in the long-run. We specifically looked out for all of the things that were identified as possible cons and haven't actually been able to identify many of them as real cons since we've been driving the car regularly.

The interior is beautiful and well set up. I did find that some plastic parts broke pretty easily though. I bought this car when it was about six years old. I put very few miles on it but spent a lot of money on repairs.

I found an independent garage opened by a Volvo Certified Master Tech and he sorted it out right away (nearest Volvo dealership is over 2 hours from me)- the radio died in 2011 (it was 7 years old) but I was able to replace it with one found from a salvaged xc90 in 2012 and saved a lot of money by waiting for a salvaged radio vs. a new replacement ($80 + installation)- In 2014 (at 10 years old) we knew that there were some significant bits that needed to be replaced simply due to wear and tear - belts, water pump, blower fan was starting to go and the starter needed replacing. Thought about selling it but we had a rash of bad luck with BMWs and even a Porshe Cayman.  My XC90 was still running great and the estimate to get all of the worn out pieces replaced was far far cheaper than getting another car. We even bought some new floor mats - no one believes this car is 11 years old. It rides and looks like a much newer car. So here I am, 9 years after I bought it and still love it.  The driver's seat is getting a bit worn but the rest of the car is still in amazing shape. The fabric on the roof has a bit of a droop in a place behind the backseat light and the weatherstripping is a bit worse for wear but these are all cosmetic. Mechanically it drives as beautifully as the day I bought it.  Next year I'm probably going to look at getting a pre-owned XC60 or maybe another XC90 but I'm keeping this 2004 for my daughter.   She doesn't start driving for another few years but I have full faith that this car has many more years left.

What is under the hood is another story.  It is riddled with repair issues.  I have already owned two of them because Volvo bought back my first one. My 2016 R-Design version had the check engine light on when I purchased it.  This recurred several more times and it took several more visits to the service shop to repair.  Then, my sun roof had a major leak, which I discovered after my free shower from the Costco car wash.  I had multiple issues with my temperature control systems and some repair on the fuel system, all requiring repairs.  Each repair, always took a minimum of 2 days (and those were rare). Most repairs took 5 business days, so I didn't have use of my car for well over 30 days. It only had 15,000 miles when they bought it back.  There were two issues they couldn't figure.  The seats would squeak when going over a small bump in the road (it sounded like nails on a chalkboard).  I had major issues pumping gas.  At certain gas stations, the pump would keep clicking off, so I couldn't tell how much gas was in the car.  One time, it wouldn't allow me to pump gas at all. It just kept clicking off.  I really liked the features of the car, so after Volvo bought back the 2016 I purchased two model years later, the 2018 XC90 T8 Inscription (also a plug-in hybrid).

After owning the huge Mercedes GL, we decided on something a wee bit smaller but just as practical.  The two contenders ended up being the new Volvo XC90 and the Audi Q7. We had an Audi Allroad which we loved to drive, but the back seat was becoming far two cramped for our nearly teenage son. We found the same to be true about the Audi Q7, as big as the car was, there wasn't a lot of leg room in the backseats.  The Volvo XC90 had far more leg room in the backseats and was more comfortable to drive in for long distances. (SF to SD is 10 long hours.) And the third row was much more comfortable, according to our preteen. My hubby calls is it the perfect mom car, he drives an BMW X5 for reference, compared to his car I love the smooth comfortable ride and acceleration.  The seats are comfortable to be in for long hours of driving and I don't feel like I need to see the chiropractor after going over continuous speed bumps or bumpy surfaces.  He does find the find the contoured seats a bit confining at 6'4"" with a bit a girth on the sides and it did limit us to getting the R version which I really liked.  The only downfall is that our XC90 has spent a crazy amount of time in the shop. Not purely sure that is the cars fault though, as our garage gives a loaner, and sometimes I think it is just easier for them to get through the amount of work they need to get done on cars if they keep our Volvo a few more days. My husband does call me the Beta tester though. So far we have had our supercharger malfunction, which is always fun at toll booths that are slow down but please don't stop and accelerate like made when done.  Our battery went before a year, if your car starts doing really crazy things it might be time for a new battery. And our USB port stopped working, not good when you have preteens. But overall,  we have been really satisfied with the car. The only major complaint we have is that the back row is not electric, so it requires a bit of work to navigate the seats, including the middle row. We don't move the middle row around enough to remember exactly the sequence we need to work in to facilitate the seat doing exactly what we want.  It tends to get stuck in sometimes crazy positions.

 on 08/17/16 07:54 AM (PDT),Mike ,2017 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Inscription 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),2017 XC90 T6 Inscription - 6 weeks into Ownership," One of the irritations I have is the disconnect between the 2017 Owner's manual and Volvo's support.  They list functions in the manual that just flat out are not there nor are available.  Seems somewhat dishonest to me.  For example, Volvo lists how to use the egress / ingress function for getting out of the SUV and into the SUV.  However, when I contacted Volvo, they said this function is not available, never has been and maybe under development as a future software upgrade.  Not sure how they can put the option in print when they don't even have it developed.  Second example is the manual shows a 110v outlet in the center console for passengers in the 2nd row to plug in devices.   However, that was only available in their 2016 model, again, according to the email I got from Volvo.  However, the manual is titled ""2017 XC90"".  I have found two other functions that are not available in the XC90 US model but available in Canada.   One would think they would have defined that better up front.  Thus, owners beware, Volvo isn't totally honest in what is / is not available in the 2017 T6 in the US.  As for the car itself.  I didn't get the 4 corner suspension (I ordered it but for some reason (either dealer or Volvo error) it didn't come with it.  However, the ride is comfortable and about the same as in our 2011 Chrysler Town and Country.   Gas mileage is ok, I'm averaging around 22 mostly in town.  Best gas mileage is in cursing mode.  It really sucks the gas when taking off and probably is where it falls short a little.  Does have some great safety features but also falls short.  For example, the lane assist where it is to alert you if you drift to far left or right, is not reliable.  There are times when it should have alerted but easily let me cross the center line either having no notification or late in notifying me.  Hence a head-on-collision would have already taken place.  My 2014 GMC 1500 truck has the same feature and works perfectly all the time.  Not sure why a $75,000 vehicle doesn't have the same accuracy.  Pilot assist works as designed. As long as the lane markings can be identified, it does auto steer the car up to 80 mph.  You do have to interact with the steering wheel every 30 -45 secs however or it will auto disengage.  The scary part is that there are times when the system, apparently, looses the ability to see the lane markings and just disengages without any warning to the driver.  I would think, again, for this high end vehicle, it should alarm if the system is disengaging.    Thank goodness I have not had to test the auto braking if a car turns in front or to avoid a rear end collision.  I'm assuming it will work when required.  The active cruise adapter works well and you can set the distance (actually set the secs) within which you want the car to adjust the speed based on the car in front.  The seats are very comfortable but getting in and out of the vehicle is difficult unless you retract and lower the seat.  I'm 5' 10"" and if I don't lower the seat all the way done, I will hit my head getting out.  Climate controls work well as do the ventilated / heated seats.  2nd row seating is about as comfortable as in other vehicles.  3rd row quite frankly is limited to children.  Very difficult for adults to get in and out of the back.  Not adult friendly.  As with reviews of the 2016 model the lack of USB ports is a glaring deficiency in a high vehicle in this price group.  Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle but would I buy it again, I don't know.  I would look closer at the new 2017 Mercedes I think.",4.0,"2017 XC90 T6 Inscription - 6 weeks into Ownership One of the irritations I have is the disconnect between the 2017 Owner's manual and Volvo's support.

I didn't get the 4 corner suspension (I ordered it but for some reason (either dealer or Volvo error) it didn't come with it.  However, the ride is comfortable and about the same as in our 2011 Chrysler Town and Country.   Gas mileage is ok, I'm averaging around 22 mostly in town.  Best gas mileage is in cursing mode.  It really sucks the gas when taking off and probably is where it falls short a little.  Does have some great safety features but also falls short.  For example, the lane assist where it is to alert you if you drift to far left or right, is not reliable.  There are times when it should have alerted but easily let me cross the center line either having no notification or late in notifying me.  Hence a head-on-collision would have already taken place.  My 2014 GMC 1500 truck has the same feature and works perfectly all the time.  Not sure why a $75,000 vehicle doesn't have the same accuracy.  Pilot assist works as designed. As long as the lane markings can be identified, it does auto steer the car up to 80 mph.  You do have to interact with the steering wheel every 30 -45 secs however or it will auto disengage.  The scary part is that there are times when the system, apparently, looses the ability to see the lane markings and just disengages without any warning to the driver.  I would think, again, for this high end vehicle, it should alarm if the system is disengaging.    Thank goodness I have not had to test the auto braking if a car turns in front or to avoid a rear end collision.  I'm assuming it will work when required.  The active cruise adapter works well and you can set the distance (actually set the secs) within which you want the car to adjust the speed based on the car in front.  The seats are very comfortable but getting in and out of the vehicle is difficult unless you retract and lower the seat.  I'm 5' 10"" and if I don't lower the seat all the way done, I will hit my head getting out.  Climate controls work well as do the ventilated / heated seats.  2nd row seating is about as comfortable as in other vehicles.  3rd row quite frankly is limited to children.  Very difficult for adults to get in and out of the back.  Not adult friendly.  As with reviews of the 2016 model the lack of USB ports is a glaring deficiency in a high vehicle in this price group.  Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle but would I buy it again, I don't know.  I would look closer at the new 2017 Mercedes I think.","[('XC90 model', 'model'), ('US model', 'model'), ('Gas mileage', 'mileage'), ('gas mileage', 'mileage')]","['other functions', 'However titled', 'far left', 'Best Gas gas mileage', 'really sucks']","[['nt'], ['one'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'think'], ['one'], ['car'], ['come'], ['nt'], ['great'], ['nt'], ['take'], ['work', 'truck'], ['vehicle'], ['work'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt'], ['drive', 'nt', 'car'], ['vehicle', 'think'], ['nt', 'good', 'car', 'test'], ['work'], ['nt', 'car', 'work'], ['vehicle'], ['one'], ['nt', 'work'], ['vehicle'], ['child'], ['vehicle'], ['vehicle', 'now'], ['think', 'new']]","[('softw upgrade', 'upgrade'), ('110v outlet', 'outlet'), ('center console', 'console'), ('corner suspension', 'suspension'), ('Volvo error', 'error'), ('safety features', 'features'), ('T times', 'times'), ('center line', 'line'), ('Pilot assist', 'assist'), ('lane markings', 'markings'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('t times', 'times'), ('lane markings', 'markings'), ('end vehicle', 'vehicle'), ('auto braking', 'braking'), ('end collision', 'collision'), ('cruise adapter', 'adapter'), ('Climate controls', 'controls'), ('row seating', 'seating'), ('3rd row', 'row'), ('USB ports', 'ports'), ('price group', 'group')]","['great safety features', 'works perfectly', 'already taken', 'Thus beware', 'actually set', 'same accuracy', 'long steer', 'easily let', 'buy again', 'high end vehicle', 'scary part', 'rear end', 'look closer', 'same feature', 'apparently looses', 'Hence taken', 'heated seats', 'However contacted', 'interact however', 'glaring deficiency', 'future softw upgrade', 'ingress function', 'active cruise adapter', 'think again', 'work well', '2nd 3rd row', 'even have', 'works well', 'Second example', 'other end vehicles']",neg

 on 10/08/17 21:33 PM (PDT),Matt H. ,2016 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Inscription 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),Long Term Review," We bought our 2016 XC90 T6 Inscription in December of 2015 with only 3 miles on it straight from the factory. It had every available package, except air suspension. We also had the 21"" upgraded wheels, and later added the towing package when the parts became available a couple weeks later. Ours also came with Apple pay at no additional cost before Apple decided to start making the car companies make their dealers (and subsequently buyers) pay for it. Since then, we've also paid for some software upgrades. Just recently we paid to have the Auto Pilot upgraded to Auto Pilot Assist 2 for 2017. This was well worth the money to upgrade since it gives our older model semi-autonomous features. So far we've loved it. We also renewed our Volvo on Call service through the rest of the life our vehicle loan because we like the remote start feature since we live in Colorado where we get snow during the winter. Now onto my actual review. We've had the vehicle almost two full years now with minimal issues. I've noticed several reviews that gave bad ratings due to software issues. I can understand that for factory delivered vehicles. They were brand new and they shipped with bugs already in the systems, Volvo pushes several software updates to the dealers every month, and so the vehicle is in a constant state of repair basically because the car is so loaded with technology. We've never had any issues with software but only once when the OS would randomly reboot itself. That ended up getting fixed with a software update. Mechanically we've only had 3 issues, one being the rear brakes were heavily squealing. They gave us the upgraded rotors due to that being a known issue on early 2016 models which was covered under warranty. Our second mechanical issue came when the blinkers would fail to work and it popped an error. We brought it into service, and they replaced the entire assembly, new controls, wiring, and software which fixed the issue, they had the car for two days but they've always given us a loaner vehicle, even when brought in for a regular interval service. Everything was covered under warranty. We also recently had a fuel sensor go out, which was also under warranty. We've gotten a few recalls since we've had the vehicle, but none were ever issues that would jeopardize safety and all were fixed promptly at the dealership, about 95% of them were all software recalls. That has been the extent of any trouble we've seen, which to us has been pretty minimal. We had a brand new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee before we bought our XC90 and it had 14 recalls in the first year we purchased it, most of them were life threatening major mechanical issues, and we were extremely unhappy with both the vehicle, and our quality of service with Jeep, and will most likely never go back. Volvo's service department near us has been absolutely wonderful, and some of the best service we've gotten from any industry. They go out of their way to make us 100% happy when we step out that door and we've been extremely happy with customer service. Now for nitpicks we didn't like after owning it for this amount of time. There needs to be more USB ports. The 2016 model only has one in the entire vehicle, and I believe the 18' models now has 3. In all honesty, it needs at least 4. 2 in the front and 2 in the back for passengers. The 18' XC40 has wireless phone charging, which I would also like to see in the XC90 range at some point. We noticed a significant difference between the lower end models and our model with road comfort, and that's due to the upgraded 21"" rims. With less tire on the road, there's less cushion for a smoother ride, so while you feel more bumps, it's still extremely quiet. It has some of the best seats in the industry and has been great for long car rides. In the future however, we'll be not doing the upgraded wheels since we learned that makes a large difference in ride comfort. That doesn't effect our review negatively since that was a choice that we made when purchasing, but just something to keep in mind for future buyers. Gas mileage has been less than advertised, but it's worth it to note that both me and my wife are heavy on the foot at stops. We do keep the start/stop feature on, but forget to turn on echo mode on the highway which makes a difference. We also mostly do city driving which also makes a difference in gas mileage overall. When we're on road trips or actively trying to conserve gas we get an average of about 24, which is closer to the actual estimated. I feel that letting you know how we drive the vehicle makes a difference in why our combined MPG is the number it is and not something higher, which it could definitely get. Other than that, we've been extremely happy with our XC90 and can't wait to get our next Volvo in the future.",5.0,"Long Term Review We bought our 2016 XC90 T6 Inscription in December of 2015 with only 3 miles on it straight from the factory.

However, it has had one electronic glitch after another-each computer reboot leads to a new issue that can't seemed to be resolved at the dealer (Volvo of Louisville).  The touch pad has gone completely blank, the temperature gauge can have wild swings, the apps don't work well- the latest is that when I start the car or first back it up in the morning, the radio changes from sirius XM to a Christian FM channel.  I have the beige Napa leather seats but the drivers seat has worn thru the finish and I await a new seat cover for a car that is 11 months old.  Unless you have much time to spend  at the dealer, I would not recommend this vehicle.  I tried to trade it in, at the dealer where it was purchased,  and was told I would have to pay $52000 in addition to turning in this vehicle to get an similar XC90 ($32000 is owed).  Shocking, right? but Kelly the manager said this was her best offer.  Do the math, my car is worth about $23000 according to this manager.  I would consider this extremely poor resale or an extremely poor manager.  Anyhow I'm stuck with an untrustworthy and overpriced vehicle for now.UPDATE (March 2018):  Most glitches have been worked out except now my phone wonât pair with the car.  I opted not to pay for Volvo on Call ($10/month) so most apps donât work.  Drivers seat cover was replaced but still stains badly and never looks good. It was deemed that the passenger seat was not worn enough to warrant replacement but it just doesnât look good for a luxury car.  Would not buy this car again despite itâs great ride.UPDATE: Sept 2018: The electronic glitches seemed to have been corrected.  Same issues with the seats- they stain very easily. I did take out the seat warranty but doubt it will cover.  The dent warranty didnât cover a fist sized dent when I accidentally backed into an ornamental tree. Yes, the back up sensor was beeping but I was trying to avoid the basketball goal and didnât see the tree!

It was one of the first models, fresh off  the assembly line. It is a beautiful car. But don't let it's looks fool you. The first 6 months were great. Then things started to go downhill. The first thing that happened was the hood flew open while we were driving. Luckily we were on a city street and were only driving 30 miles per hour; this could have been a disaster. We had the car towed to the dealer. They identified a faulty hood release and fixed the body work free of charge. Next we started to notice that the safety system is too sensitive. We had 2 instances of the car stopping itself (braking) for no apparent reason while in city traffic. Again, disaster was averted due to low speed and traffic. The car also has electronic and braking issues. Out of the blue the brakes started squealing and grinding to the point that it was undrivable  (at 11k miles). Had it towed to the dealer where the front and rear brakes and rotors had to be replaced. While there, I asked that the software be updated (the dealer couldn't manage to figure it out when I was last there). They had problems with it. My car was out of service for 2 weeks due to an inability to update the software that controls many features of the car. A week after I picked it up I took it back because the brake light would not go off and all of the tire sensors were on. It's been there for the last 2 weeks and they can't figure out how to fix the issues.

I had test drove a Focus RT and a Veloster Turbo but just fell in love with the C30.  I found the build quality and ride to be so much better than the other two cars. Although mine is a barebones Model (does not even have cruise control), the prior owner had had all the work done on the car at the dealership. As such, it was very well taken care of.  Interior of the care is simple but effective. I am not a small person but find it very comfortable in the front seat. Although the back seats are supposed to be ""roomy"", I have long legs so there would be no leg room behind me. Besides, it is always a pain to get in and out of the back seat of a small coupe. As such, no one but my dog rides in the back seat. It did not take me very long to get used to the 'waterfall' control system and now find it very easy to use. Performace, the car is great. Yes, it does not get the best fuel economy but it is a performance car. If I wanted fuel economy I would have bought the Focus or the Veloster. The engine produced plenty of horse-power and I have yet to have an issue merging or passing. But what I really like is that the power and performance are matched to a great ride. I love taking this car to my parents hours (6 hours away). The looks of the car are what really drew me to it. It has a unique look that stands out in the sea of hatchbacks. However, that looks does come at a cost. The hatch itself smaller than the rest of the storage area so it does limit the size of objects you can carry in the back. Since I do not have people ride in the back seat, I can fold them down and have lots of room. Also, the large B-pillars do make it difficult to see, producing some large blind spots. The only issue I have had with this car in three years is a bad PCV. This  caused the engine to ""whistle"" as well as the check engine light to come on. It was not exactly a cheap fix (I had the dealer fix it) but it is all good now. If you have a Volvo with this engine and you hear the engine ""whine"" or ""whistle"" then get it to a repair shop quickly as delaying could cause my greater damage. (I was able to avoid that.)
