 on 05/23/18 06:57 AM (PDT),Bill From MI ,2007 Toyota Avalon Sedan Touring 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 5A),280K MIles and Very Relieable," I have owned a 2007 Touring model for 3 years.  I purchased with 180K miles after my Lexus LS430 was totaled.  I looked at a number of Avalons but did not want to spend over $10K for a lower mileage one because I drive over 30K miles per year.  I bought this specific car thinking that I might drive it for a year while I looked for another LS430.  I love the handling and comfort of this car. It does not ride as soft as the LS but it easier to drive because it just soaks up the miles without much steering correction.  I tried the Limited model first but found the cooled seats were not as comfortable as those without this feature.  I specifically looked for a model that did NOT have the sunroof as this feature limits headroom (I'm 6'2"") and need the extra 3"" or so that models without the sunroom have.  I have put a new battery and brakes on this car.  Those have been the only repairs in 100K miles.  No check engine lights.  No weird noises.  Great acceleration.  This is a roomy car with a huge back seat.  It's not fair to compare with the LS 430 that costs twice as much but there are some areas that seem to not be as nice-like the trunk carpet and trim.  Overall, this has been a great used car for us-I would purchase again and recommend to anyone looking for a large dependable sedan.  Because everyone wants an SUV these tend to be lower priced on the used market (compared to SUV's) and make a great buy for people looking for reasonable transportation.",5.0,"280K MIles and Very Relieable I have owned a 2007 Touring model for 3 years.

If that's you... Then STOP reading this. You will be offended. Toyota makes great engines and has a history of great engines, but they(and most other car companies) have made their vehicles non user friendly. And simple parts and accessories have lost their quality.What do I mean? I mean I believe toyota is going backwards from the original beauty of their older predecessors.its sad. Take my 2000 Camry with a 4cyl. All the hoses are thick and heavy duty. Made to last!every clamp and air hose is easily accessible. The 2007 Avalon however has leaks in the brake lines,coolant lines,power steering line, and windshield washer line, and it only has 140k miles!so replace all those lines. Then remove all the engine paraphernalia and look at your engine, then take your bumper off and replace your light bulbs.... See what I'm getting at.. Heck supposedly the newest cars are going to require the entire cab to be removed for an oil change!They want your money at the factory.. They don't want you doing your engine work.. Or the mechanic.. They want to narrow it down to your money and the Toyota factory. Forget aftermarket and quick fixes and good engines that last a million miles in the 70s they have you buying a new car every 300,000 miles and all the in between fixens.

I assumed I was getting a car commensurate in quality with its price, but boy was I wrong.  First, the positive.  The engine is well matched with this car and it has adequate pickup, particularly in sport mode.  It makes a very subtle but noticeable difference in acceleration.  Unfortunately, sport mode must be selected every time you drive as the car only retains normal or eco mode when you turn off the engine.  Minor detail.  The other positive is that the interior is very well laid out and looks great.  As for quality, the wind and road noise is quite noticeable in this car.  It's not a deal killer, but it is more than I would expect for something with a $40k+ MSRP.  There are also some really stupid choices Toyota made with this car such as the Nav/phone system.  I understand that certain things deactivate when you're moving, but using hands-free calling can be a hassle because if you need to call a number with an automated phone tree (for example, calling Toyota) and you must enter in a number prompt instead of speaking it, you have to pick up your phone and dial it from there.  The number pad on the car's screen deactivates.  So much for the ""safety"" aspect of hands-free.  In terms of quality, Toyota must've gone on vacation.  My analog speedometer is about 3 mph off from the digital one, an insignificant deal but an annoyance regardless.  This is common to these cars, but Toyota will not fix it as 1-3 mph variance is ""within tolerance.""  The seat heaters are nice, but the seat coolers are next to useless.  I've had seat coolers that work, but these don't do much at all.  There is also an annoying buzz/rattle coming from the door panels when the radio is on.  After four fruitless attempts to get this fixed at the dealership and with no help from the corporate office I finally took the doors apart myself and added a ton of soundproofing material.  It mitigated the issue, but I really don't think DIY is an acceptable solution to a manufacturing issue on a new, much less ""flagship,"" vehicle.  Then, there's the stereo itself.  It sounds great...  when it works.  It randomly loses connectivity with my phone and has, on multiple occasion, gone into a sequence of rebooting itself.  The problem is intermittent and cannot be replicated, so Toyota offers no assistance on fixing it.  Lastly, the car has developed an intermittent hesitation when it starts.  As best I could, I tracked it down to times when the car sat for an hour or two and the temperature was warm and humid.  I even provided video proof of it occurring.  Initially, Toyota stated that they cannot replicate the issue and ignored it, but I finally was able to get them to acknowledge it as an issue.  However, their response was to blame me and state that ""I was pushing the button wrong.""  I'm not sure how that could be the case, but I went several rounds with them before finally giving up in frustration.  While the engine has yet to not start at all, I suspect it is a matter of time as issues with cars rarely get better on their own and often progress.I've purchased several cars over the years and must say that this is the most disappointing one I've owned.

The subwoofer in the rear is very low quality. I was already not a fan of the sound system that this car came with but after 2 weeks of owning it, I decided to max out the the volume to see how it handled and ended up blowing the subwoofer. Turns out that this is a very common problem for all Toyotas that have this JBL system in it. They dry rot in the sun and weekend very quickly. When this happens, I would recommend just buying a 50 watt sub that's 4 ohms and 8"" in diameter because the stock sub cost around $280 online and a complete ripoff. They're hard to fine but do exist. Another very common problem is that the windshield wiper motor will go out unexpectedly. You will know when it happens because it won't take the wiper back down to the ""park"" position when you turn them off. I just got a quote from my local dealer and it will cost $487 to fix that. Finally, trying to maintain this car in your driveway is a pain. It's nearly impossible to get to the oil filter with just a floor jack.

 on 09/24/15 23:13 PM (PDT),Jeffrey Augustine ,2006 Toyota Avalon Sedan XL 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 5A),A Perfect Car," March 2018 Update:  Sold my Avalon for $4500. It had 104,000 miles on it and was extremely clean and well cared for. Bought a Lexus ES350 to replace it.The Lexus is a two year old lease turn in and had a low 16,000 miles on it. Price: $32,500. My Avalon was roomier and sat lower to the  ground. However, the Lexus has a quieter and smoother ride and is more luxurious in every way. The Lexus has the same 268 hp engine. However, it has a six speed transmission that makes shifting noticeably smoother to the point of not even noticing it. Both the Avalon and the Lexus are great cars. If you want to save some money, buy the Avalon. If you want a more luxurious ride, buy the Avalon. You can't go wrong on either car. My Avalon was an extremely reliable old friend, a great car that I kept for many trouble-free years. I kept it serviced per the manual and never had any problems or expenses on it except tires, brakes, and replacing all the fuel injectors after it had >90,000 miles. I have owned my 2006 Toyota Avalon for nine years now and have never had any problems. I service it regularly and it still drives exceptionally well with 97,000 miles on it. Most of my driving is on California freeways or on long road trips in the American Southwest. This is the perfect road car with plenty of acceleration, comfort, excellent heater and a/c, and a great stereo. Visibility is excellent.I put on expensive Good Year Eagle Sport tires (W speed rating) at 30,000 ,miles and this made the ride noticeably smoother and the cornering sharper than the original OEM tire. Despite Good Year's claims, these tires only really last ~20,000 miles, but the tradeoff is worth it. I put on slotted racing discs on the brakes and ceramic pads. This is a big car that drives like a midsize sports sedan. I push the car and it likes it. 85mph cruising speed @ 2500 rpm for miles across the American Southwest all day long in any season. My last big road drive was in 112 F weather Arizona and the a/c worked great; the car had no problems with the temperature. I headed up the mountain to Prescott and got caught in a monsoon, a torrential thunderstorm going uphill at 4,000 feet. There was no place to pull over on the steep mountain road so I used the Avalon's very practical and well-engineered Manumatic transmission to hand shift through the deluge going up the steep and winding grade. No problem with traction, power, or anything else in this big thunderstorm with near zero visibility. Update: I had an ignition coil fail at 100,000 miles and replaced all of them. This is a commonly reported problem on the 2006 Avalon at >95,000 miles. The replacement factory coils restored the acceleration and engine smoothness. The 2006 Avalon accelerates very quickly and smoothly in the 70-90 mph region. This makes it great for passing slower cars and trucks on freeways and the open road. 2016 is supposed to see a glut of two year old cars on lease returns. I may finally sell my 2006 Avalon and pick up a 2014 Avalon. I can sell my 2006 Avalon for about $7,000 and pick up a 2014 Avalon for ~$25,000 from a rental car company. This means a net cost of around $18,000 for at two year old Avalon with about 26,000 miles on it. The Avalon has the Lexus E350 268hp engine, transmission, and suspension and so an $18,000 price is appealing given the performance and comfort of the Avalon. If I keep the 2014 Avalon for nine years as I have with my 2006 model, then my cost of ownership is $2,000 per year plus routine maintenance. A new 2016 Camry with the same engine stickers at $32,000. However, the Camry lacks the solid ride and comfort of the larger Avalon. I have driven a few Camry rental cars while traveling and they just don't measure up to the Avalon.

I am working on getting a 2016 Limited but the price will have to right for me to give up the 2014 Touring.   Yes, I like driving a new car every two years or so but this Touring is a wonderful car.  If I can make my deal I'll trade if not I will wait another year...

With the seats all the way up I still can't see where the front of the car is and I have perfect depth perception. Backing this car to park is actually easier with the back-up camera display, so that's become the preferred parking method. The Touring has a much meaner look than the XLs or Limited because of the large frowning grill. At first I was not impressed with its look, especially with the grill extending beyond the drivers field of vision but the look grows on you. The Opera windows in the rear end in an upward point which resembles the Lexus ES 350, VW or Benz . While this is an improvement over the box look of older Avalons it just doesn't seem quite right and may have been better had the top line of the window swung down rather than up. The car I owned previously was a 2006 Lexus GS300 with 164840 miles on it and with valve and head gasket problems on two cylinders ran so smooth I wasn't aware of a problem. The Lexus also had a Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) which failed during connection with a DMV Smog Check Tester. The VCU had to be repaired before the smog test could be started ($3300 with to OX sensors as well) plus $8500 for the engine repair. I'd been waiting in the showroom for the diagnosis and was seriously impressed with a Avalon Limited. It was $7000 more than the next level Touring, mostly due to aftermarket high end 18 inch wheels and wider tires. I previously owned a 2003 Avalon XL and put 130,000 miles on it in three years. It ran excellently until the day I traded it in on the Lexus, which was a major step up. This Touring version is sportier and has some unique technology and styling but it is not a GS-300 but it certainly is much cheaper yet, in my opinion, quite similar in quality and performance with the LEXUS.  The Midnight Black paint has a very deep blue and silver metal flake, which when it catches the light, makes the car sparkle as if it had facets.  The interior three color scheme is a bit of a knock off of a Mercedes. All the Touring models come with the paddle shifters, black wood grain accents, faux leather steering wheel, which isn't as pretty as a wood accented steering wheel but it will be much better when summer comes around. The back seat can accommodate a six foot person with room to spare. There is no hump in the middle of the bnack seat because of the front wheel drive, so there is room to move your legs around and get comfortable. The pull down center armrest is poorly appointed. There is no strap to pull it down and the built in cup holders are cheap looking plastic of the same color of the seats rather than the chrome lined, accent colored ones in the front seat.

I have most of the problems people complain about: Drive line vibrations, brake shutter, wheel shutter, loud dashboard creaks and rattles. The whole truck shakes like crazy when I try to accelerate hard from a dead stop. The engine is chirping like there's a belt problem. The valves clatter when the water temp is cold. I practically have to wait for the water temp to get to normal running level before it stops. I love the truck and I want to keep it forever, but I get the feeling it either won't hold up or I'll grow to resent it.***Update:  It has been 4.5 years, 87,500 miles and not much has changed.  The belt noise wasn't the belt at all.  No one could figure it out.  Dealer charged me for belt replacement and when that didn't fix it, they tried to tell me it was the A/C compressor.   Not until I took the truck in for a recall to replace the catalytic converter did the noise go away.  Valves still clatter and click when cold.  Driveline vibration is just as bad if not worse and now I hear what I think are the u-joints chirping.  There's also a gear whine coming from powertrain.  Sound like the differential.  There's now mildew in the window guides on every door.  After a rain, it's putrid.   The windshield wipers started to howl like crazy.  They start relatively quiet, but when you drive a while in the rain they get louder and louder.   Been on my third set of different tires.  Different brand, different style and no tire store can balance the wheels.  I've isolated it to one wheel, but no one can figure it out because it shows balance.  Took the wheel off the truck and had it looked at for a possible bend or some sort of irregularity, but there's nothing wrong with it.  I remember having this problem within the first month of ownership.  Dealer kept the truck for weeks to figure it out.  One day they told me it was their machine.  Had to send it next door to Lexus for balance.  Problem was gone.  Next set of tires, same problem.  Live with it until the next set where I purchase very, very expensive, high quality Michelin's.  Same problem now a different wheel.  Took the truck to a vibration specialist.  They load balanced all the wheels at 80mph and the problem went away.  Ask the tech why this is so critical and why so expensive.  He says some vehicles are prone to it.  It's a characteristic of the car/truck.  It's expensive because there are only two places in town to get it done:  His place and Lexus.  Wow! it all makes sense now.  Point is: Toyota is well aware these trucks have issues, so why do anything about it?  They still have little competition.  Plus, they are riding on the coat tails of loyal customers, good word of mouth and long term reliability.  Well, all I can say is nothing else has broke on the truck so far, but I've own lots of cars past 150-200K miles and honestly, once you get past 100K, they tend to all hold up comparably.  I've had Honda, Kia, Chevy, Ford, Mitusbishi and VW.  The two cars I've had the fewest problems with and kept the longest?  Kia, Mitsubishi and Honda in order of most mileage.  Toyota in my opinion is nothing special.****UPDATEApproaching 120K miles and some of the chronic problems have grown worse.  Dive line vibrations are worsening.  Now there is no ""sweet spot"" with fuel tank level or payload to suppress it.  I tried new bearing shims and other aftermarket devices, remedies, shaft angle changes, etc and either no change or worse.  Next , I might try a drive line expert or beef up the rear suspension with leaf spring helpers, sway bars, etc.  I honestly don't recall noticing this vibration in the first year of ownership.  It was only after a TSB that it became apparent and slowly over time became worse.  A slight whine noise coming from the rear axle was noticed years ago.  Well, now that thing howls like wolf, but only when you reach cruising hwy speed.  Working for a power transmission company for decades has taught be that this sound is more than likely just gear mesh noise.  I suspect the gear geometry might be slightly prone to noise, but this very excitable chassis amplifies it.  Overall, my belief is that this truck is dependable overall, but chassis itself was designed mostly for off road capability and driveability is an afterthought.  Because of this, harmonics from other components in motion can be seriously intensified.  For a vehicle driven primarily on the highway, it can be frustrating.  I'm curious to know if that's why Tacoma reviews tend to brag about off road capability, while Nissan Frontier and Chevy Colorado reviews tend to hype up comfort and driveability.  It's a shame really.  Because, I feel on paper, the Tacoma has so much more potential in price, quality, styling, room, etc.  I just find it to uncomfortable for long trips.

But, when I was in the Army I bought an older base model 2wd Toyota truck. It had the Manual Transmission which was a blast to drive. I put that little truck through it's paces, especially when I went Deer hunting. After I got out of the Army and got into Law Enforcement, the idea of owning another Toyota never left my mind. I'm a big fella with 5 children, so I knew if I was going to get another Toyota, it would have to be the 4 door model. I also wanted a 4x4. So I finally found one back in 2013. It's a 2004 Tacoma, 4 Door and 4x4. Since I've had it, I know that I will never own another truck unless it's a Toyota. Now that I'm a single Father of 5 children, ages ranging from 14 to 4, all of us fit comfortably even with my 4 year old's seat. The previous owner had placed an alarm on it, which made it make that aggravating sound every time I used the remote to lock it, so I quickly disabled it. But other than that, I absolutely LOVE my truck. I've only had to use my 4 wheel drive ""low"" a couple of times when Deer hunting. It's amazing, of course the turning radius while in 4 wheel low isn't the greatest, but I think that's the case in most 4x4 trucks. But I was pleasantly surprised when I had to use the 4 low, and how easy it was to get me out of my situation's. The only negative thing I can think of about my truck is the clock location. It's located a little lower than the steering wheel and if I need to see what time it is, I have to look around the steering wheel to see it. Other than that, I think it's common knowledge that a Toyota vehicle is reliable and with regular maintenance, will last you for a very long time. I wished I could afford a new model, but maybe after I win the lottery, I guess I should start playing it first. But like I said, when it's time to pass my truck down to my boys, I will not buy anything other than a Toyota. They look great, run great, have good safety features, are fairly economical and will last it seems like forever, depending on how the owner drives it and maintains it. I'm a Patriot and I buy American made products when I can, but in my opinion there isn't an American made truck that's half as reliable as a Toyota. So drive safe, wear that seat belt, and I hope that whomever reads this has a blessed day. God Bless America and I hope God Blesses each and everyone of you.",5.0,"The Truck I've Alway's Wanted!!!!!

This new transmission is tuned for better fuel economy and that's why many are quite irritated with this transmission but the ECT fixes that.

SB (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Engineer who designed the key system is a moron!," Overall I am very happy with my Tacoma TRD Offroad.  My decision came down to the Taco or the Colorado and while in some ways the Colorado beat the Taco, I was looking for a camping, off-road, rough country performer and I felt Toyota had a superior 4WD system and was overall a more rugged vehicle.  It drives great and feels unstoppable and indestructible.  The Colorado would have been my choice if I was looking for a work truck that would spend most of its life on pavement.  The Tacoma is the best vehicle I have ever owned.That said, the remainder of this review is going to address my very low opinion of the key system for the 2016 Tacoma.  I admit that I am a little anal about keys.  I need a set, my wife needs a set and there must be an emergency set.  So the day my Tacoma arrived I went to the service department and ordered an extra set of keys.In my opinion, the Toyota engineer who designed this abomination should be stripped of his engineering credentials and reassigned to Fukushima clean-up duty!  The design is moronic and I get the impression it was cobbled together from unwanted bits and pieces of other Toyota vehicles.  And God help you if your ever need to order a duplicate set!It takes no less than THREE (3) keys to fully operate the Tacoma.   I've never heard of a vehicle that required 3 different keys to operate. There is one key for the tail gate.  All it does is unlock the tailgate.  It is just a simple mechanical lock.  Toyota does not even bother to give you an extra one; they just give you only one key.  If you order a spare key you are in for a surprise.  The key blank is a $30 chip key but the CHIP DOES NOT DO ANYTHING because the lock is just a simple mechanical lock.  So instead of selling you a $3 blank they sell you a $30 blank with a worthless chip in it.  But at least these keys can be cut locally at your dealer.  I actually got this key the same day which is far better than I did with the other two keys.The doors and ignition keys need to be special ordered and they don't come quick.  I pity the poor fool who loses his keys because you might not get into your vehicle for two weeks while you wait on Toyota to pull their head from the nether regions and actually come up with a replacement.  It is really two keys: an electronic proximity fob and a laser-cut mechanical key which stows cleverly inside of the fob.  They cost about $150 dollars EACH which is beyond obscene and totally unnecessary.  To add insult to injury, the fob costs an additional $55 to program.The fob can lock and unlock the doors with a push of a fob button or if it is in close proximity allow the key-holder to unlock and lock the drivers door by swiping the driver's door handle which is pretty neat but I bet I will be cursing that thing when it fails about 20 years from now.  The fob also is needed to start the vehicle and must be in proximity (your pants pocket works) of the push button start which looks to be a leftover from a Prius.  The fob is what you would give to a valet attendant and pray to god he does not lose that nearly priceless piece of hardware.   I finally got my extra fob about 10 days after I ordered it.  Thank goodness I was not locked out of my vehicle!The mechanical laser cut key can unlock the driver's door (nice if the battery is dead), and can also unlock the glove box.  You would retain this when you gave the fob to the valet attendant which is clever.   But why, Why, WHY could the witless Toyota engineer not design the tailgate to use this same key?  How stupid is that?   And what advantage is there to this laser cutting technology where a customer in Wyoming has to wait for a key to be cut at enormous cost in Battlefield Missouri?  I am failing to see or appreciate the $150 of added utility over a simple $3 mechanically cut key that I could get made in 5 minutes any hardware store locally.  Three weeks after ordering, I am still waiting for my replacement key.  The first one was completely the wrong blank.  It was too wide to fit in the fob or the lock.  The 2nd one was cut from the correct blank and fit in the fob and the door lock but was cut with completely the wrong pattern and now I am hoping that about a week from now (a month total), the third try will prove to be the charm.

Tacoma Access Cab for about 2 1/2 years now.  I had a software update done for the constantly shifting problem and it helped a lot.  It shifts less frequently now and the shift points seem to be at a higher speed for each gear.  The software update is  TSB 0077-17.    The drone from the engine and exhaust is LOUD! The new Atkinson Cycle engine may have more horsepower, but it doesn't show. Acceleration is slow - much less than what I get from my 2013 6 cyl. Highlander. It rides rough! You definitely will know you are riding in truck. The step-up into the truck is high and awkward. The driver's seat is way too low and it's uncomfortable. It handles well and gas mileage is 20 -23 depending on the trip distance. Instrumentation, gauges, etc. are fine, but the temp control and fan speed is hard to decipher. The composite bed is nice and saves buying a liner. I use it as a truck and bought it for reliability, so it works for me. If you're looking for a quiet, smooth ride with barely noticeable shifting, you don't want a Tacoma. If you're looking for a reliable work truck, this one is tops.     I will note that with a yard of mulch or a half yard of crushed gravel in the bed it rides much better and the shifting is a lot smoother.  But for everyday use, Toyota could have done a much better job with the suspension, noise suppression and the transmission.  Mileage now (04/18) is 8000.   The truck's obsession with frequent shifting was annoying to say the least, but the software update has improved that greatly.

It handles well and gas mileage is 20 -23 depending on the trip distance. Instrumentation, gauges, etc. are fine, but the temp control and fan speed is hard to decipher. The composite bed is nice and saves buying a liner. I use it as a truck and bought it for reliability, so it works for me. If you're looking for a quiet, smooth ride with barely noticeable shifting, you don't want a Tacoma. If you're looking for a reliable work truck, this one is tops.     I will note that with a yard of mulch or a half yard of crushed gravel in the bed it rides much better and the shifting is a lot smoother.  But for everyday use, Toyota could have done a much better job with the suspension, noise suppression and the transmission.  Mileage now (04/18) is 8000.   The truck's obsession with frequent shifting was annoying to say the least, but the software update has improved that greatly.   The engine/transmission matchup on this truck might produce good mileage, but it's a real nuisance to drive.","[('trip distance', 'distance')]","['crushed gravel', 'softw update', 'handles well', 'composite bed']","[['year', 'now'], ['nt', 'one'], ['nt'], ['one', 'new'], ['truck'], ['nt', 'truck'], ['drive'], ['nt', 'etc'], ['nt'], ['bought', 'work', 'truck'], ['nt'], ['work', 'one', 'truck'], ['one'], ['nt', 'truck', 'great'], ['drive', 'good', 'truck']]","[('shift points', 'points'), ('Atkinson Cycle', 'Cycle'), ('Cycle engine', 'engine'), ('temp control', 'control'), ('fan speed', 'speed'), ('work truck', 'truck'), ('noise suppression', 'suppression'), ('softw update', 'update'), ('transmission matchup', 'matchup')]","['good mileage', 'barely noticeable shifting', 'more horsepower', 'new Cycle engine', 'constantly shifting', 'noticeable shifting', 'much better job', 'reliable work truck', 'smooth ride', 'higher fan speed', 'quiet ride', 'annoying to say', 'everyday use', 'frequent shifting', 'better job', 'improved greatly', 'real nuisance']",neg

SB (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Lexus of Lighter Duty Trucks," First I would like to start out by saying thank you to Steve Gomez and the staff at Gulf Coast Toyota in Angleton, TX.  I traveled almost 200 miles to purchase My 2016 TRD Sport from them because they are strait up and didn't make me pay MSRP.  I visited at least 5 dealerships and test drove both access and double cab models with four cylinder and six cylinder combinations (only 4x2 models).  For me, the white V6 automatic TRD Sport 4x2 with a regular bed was the winner.  This made the most sense in terms of my needs and value.  This truck came with the V6 engine, upgraded stereo receiver (bigger screen), traction control, tow package, alloy rims, bed liner, nitrogen in the tires, day time running LEDs, push-to-start, and tint.  It did not come with blindspot indicators or the side steps, but my foot is too large for the ""cute"" sidesteps Toyota likes to install.  I put 700 miles, highway and city, on the truck in the first week and I am very pleased.I almost didn't purchase the truck after reading reviews on some industry respected sites. Particularly, the reviews regarding the transmission ""having a difficult time finding a gear at higher speeds"" was a major concern for me.  I have not found this to be an issue.  Currently, the only time I can remotely reproduce the issue is when I am purposefully erratic with the gas pedal at high speeds.  Having owned 30+ cars, including a GS Lexus, I believe a slight delay in RPM re-stabilization is normal for most cars that have more than 6 automatic transmission gears.   Enjoying/maintaining excellent ride and comfort requires a responsible driver and wisdom, but I digress.  I will note that the aforementioned ""questionable transmission"" reviews were in almost all cases regarding the 4x4 models.  Also, keep in mind that the RX 350 and GS350 now come with a variation of this same exact engine.I have noticed one thing.  If I park the truck, open driver door, and then turn off the engine, the truck likes to make an annoying beeping sound until I close the driver door.  However, if I park the truck, turn off the engine, and then open the door there isn't an annoying beeping sound.  One would hope that the a 2016 truck would be equipped with the processing power to understand ""yes, the door was opened prior to engine shut off, but the engine has subsequently been shut down so stop the freaking beeping"".  It may have been intentionally designed this way, but I am more than willing pull out the old C++ compiler if that is acceptable :-).Overall, Toyota nailed it in 2016 with the 4x2 TRD Sport.

Totally drank the Kool Aid. We ordered our TRD-OR 4 dr lb and waited 4 months for it to arrive. We took our first trip- a camping trip that took us over the divide to south western Montana.

Then the tranny starting shifting erratically, up-down, up-down.. It would never hold a gear. Took it to the dealer to perform the TSB update on the tranny- service department at first said ""No TSB exists"". I had to do an internet search and show it to them. TSB flash fixed it for about 500 miles, then it reverted back to erratic shifting. Also- dealer said mpg's ""Will get better after 2,000 miles or so"".. Third problem- the hood support braces are glued to the hood. 75% of the glue points failed, and my truck had a wavy hood at highway speed. If the sun glint was just right, it was like having a disco ball in the cab. Very annoying. Fourth problem- after 6 months and 14,000 miles the truck differential started howling and moaning. At this point the avg MPG was 16 (yes- 16), even after a long highway trip from Montana to Ohio. The dealer refused to address the hood- they said ""Normal Characteristic of the truck"", my tranny still shifted erratically and the car was unsuited for long distance travel. We had it. We drove over to the Chevy dealer, test drove a 1500 Silverado with a 6.2L V8 and 8spd tranny and got a decent trade on the Tacoma.

Third problem- the hood support braces are glued to the hood. 75% of the glue points failed, and my truck had a wavy hood at highway speed. If the sun glint was just right, it was like having a disco ball in the cab. Very annoying. Fourth problem- after 6 months and 14,000 miles the truck differential started howling and moaning. At this point the avg MPG was 16 (yes- 16), even after a long highway trip from Montana to Ohio. The dealer refused to address the hood- they said ""Normal Characteristic of the truck"", my tranny still shifted erratically and the car was unsuited for long distance travel. We had it. We drove over to the Chevy dealer, test drove a 1500 Silverado with a 6.2L V8 and 8spd tranny and got a decent trade on the Tacoma. No shifting issues, no wavy hood, no groaning differential and I'm getting 19mpg on average. Toyota really duffed this Tacoma.

 on 02/26/18 10:11 AM (PST),Keven Nguyen ,2017 Toyota Sienna Minivan XLE Premium 8-Passenger 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 8A),"The new 8sp Transmission, it has problems!"," 2017 Sienna, XLE 5,255 miles.I noticed a light whining sound during drive/acceleration about a day or two before the first breakdown.  The whining sound comes on and you can hear it faintly with the foot on the gas.  You don't need to engage the acceleration, just keep your foot on the pedal lightly and you'll hear the whine, once you let go, the whining goes away.We didnât have any problem with trips closer to home, the farthest weâve driven locally was about 40 miles.  We took our first of town trip on Friday, Feb 16th.  This trip was the farthest drive the Sienna has encounter, one hundred and twenty six miles, with a travel time of two hours.  After we got off the freeway with our exit, at the first stop light, when downshifting from 2nd to first, we heard a âclunkâ and a jerked is felt.  Then another light, the continued âclunkâ and jerked progresses, the intensity has increased.  It started to happen more frequent, at every stop light, the downshifting jerks, âclunkâ, and pulls, sometimes it felt as if we were rear ended by the car from behind.  Then on the acceleration from stop to go, the van started to upshifts too soon, therefore, it didnât have any momentum.  It was also slipping/not engaging in 3rd gear.  Over the course of the next 30 minutes, all the skipping, jerking, pulling, clunking, every gear change.  They were loud, and felt like we were hit by another car from the rear.  We were pretty much rolling on first and second gear, no 3rd gear, vibration on 4thâ¦  There were no check engine lights, no warning lights of any kind.  Finally, the check engine light came on, then shortly, the anti-slipping light came on, then the failed safely brake came on, then it just wouldnât go forward or backward anymore.  We barely managed to roll off to the side of the road from the intersection.  I, my wife, our 2 yr old daughter, and our 3 month old; we were stranded out of town, late after 7pm in the evening.I used Toyota Roadside Assistance and waited an hour and a half for the tow truck to arrive.  The van was towed to Stevens Creek Toyota for an overnight drop off.  It took the dealer several days figure out the situation and to get repair instructions from Toyota.  They performed two software updates on the Transmission ECU and the throttle body.  I was provided a loaner to drive while the van was being serviced.I had to clear my schedule the following Saturday and drive back to San Jose to return the loaner and pickup my van.  The refreshed van seems to be doing fine on all the short drive in town.  However, the problem started again after the long drive back home.  As soon as we take the first exit off the freeway, while coming to a stop, a âclunkâ and jerk from the downshift from 2nd to first gear is heard and felt.  This âclunkâ and harsh jerk was happening here and there, not as often as it did on the our first breakdown.  I  didnât want to take any chances of breaking down on the road again, so I drove the vehicle straight to Maita Toyota dealer in Sacramento.  I took on another loaner and wait to hear from the dealer again.  I don't think the problem will go away from software updates, it's probably just a bad transmission design somehow, this is the first year of the 8sp transmission, so it is a real problem.  I still have to go through this problem a few more times, then Toyota will have to buy this back under lemon law.  Even though we love this car for the comfort, I don't want to deal with all the problems and wasting time anymore.  To summarize all this up:-	2017 Sienna 5,255 miles-	The bad shifting/clunking/skipping gear/missing gear seems to happen after a long drive 1.5-2hrs, after the transmission gets hot.-	First sign of problem is whining noise-	Second sign of problem is downshift into first gear, when coming to a stop.-	3rd and continued sign of problem is more downshifts and upshift felt and noise-	After a few more lights of the continued sign, get ready to pull to the side and call for tow.",3.0,"The new 8sp Transmission, it has problems! 2017 Sienna, XLE 5,255 miles.I noticed a light whining sound during drive/acceleration about a day or two before the first breakdown.

 on 10/16/17 18:46 PM (PDT),Stephen ,2017 Toyota Sienna Minivan Limited Premium 7-Passenger 4dr Minivan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Not a fan of this van.," I have waited several months to review this vehicle, waiting to have something more positive to say about it. I had low expectations when I decided to shop for a minivan.  I bought a fully loaded Sienna thinking that i would be buying the best of several bad options. I probably did, but that reflects poorly on the choices available today. I will lead with the most positive thing I have to say about it. The captains chairs in the back seat are very comfortable as back seats go. There is lots of adjustability fore and aft, allowing for a lot of leeway in the 2nd and 3rd row in terms of leg room. Even the 3rd row has reclining backs.  It is the most comfortable Iâve ever encountered and the rest of the passengers donât have to suffer for it. But they will suffer for other reasons. The Sienna just has many ergonomic issues and just poor implementation of what other manufacturers have been doing right for over a decade. I tend to buy high end German cars, but even my old 2003 FX35 had a more functional Nav/infotainment package.  This is my 9th car with a modern nav/infotainment system.  I can think of only one that was worse. It relies almost exclusively on voice commands to run all of it. Iâve gone through the voice training exercises but it didnât help for me. Iâve had cars with voice control for 10 yrs now but this system requires that you use it. Your passenger cannot help you out. Iâve had in car internet/WiFi in several cars since 2012, and my Toyota salesman was convincing in his claim that their cellphone based app would get me a lot of the same features. I drive a lot and use Nav heavily. I was depending on the app to serve as my seamless internet portal to provide an up to date database of POIs. I was disappointed to learn that the app/van require a sign in (username and password) ever time the car is turned on. Bluetooth calls work as youâd expect but the app log in makes it virtually useless. Prepare to use your phone for everything as though you bought a $20K car. My service manager said that he doesnât use it either and suggested that I just use SIRI and Bluetooth it into the vanâs speakers. The console is a horrible deep bin. A bin with no light, USB, or 12V socket. There is one USB slot on the dash but none in either glove box. There is a sizeable gap between the console and the dash. I still donât know why. A sloppy purse receptacle? So if you are wanting to charge your phone you have to drape the cord across the gap to a cup holder. Itâs only a matter of time before my dogs tear the whole thing out, USB slot and all. There is no convenient place to put your phone out of sight.  I was disappointed with the DVD and drop down monitor. Supposedly you can do split screen video on that wide screen. I think there is an HDMI input somewhere for it. Maybe I had a setting wrong but the dvd image was not widescreen format even though it was centered on the really wide monitor. The door armrests up front are horrible. 30 yrs later and exactly the same as my dadâs 1987 Camry. 1/4â of foam batting over a fiberboard armrest. Really uncomfortable after an hour of use. Plus, I drove my elbo through that Camry armrest eventually. :-)   The leather? on the center armrest is really cheap looking. I donât use it for fear of destroying it before I resell the thing. The braking is alarmingly worse than my Q7 despite being1000lbs lighter. The acceleration is much worse too despite being lighter and having a much bigger V6. It does get better mileage at 20-22.5 mpg. Speaking of gas, Iâm still not used to unlocking the fuel door from the inside. All of our cars since 2007 have used the same keyless entry that the doors use. My van has keyless entry but it is not connected to the fuel door. The transmission feels pretty sloppy when itâs searching for a gear sometimes. I donât know if itâs wearing or just a poor transmission.  The weirdest issue Iâve had with it revolves around cargo. I brought 2X10s home from the hardware store. I was amazed to find that there was no handle or hook to secure the hatch, inside or out. I also transported two sheets of plywood in the van. (It was a selling point for me). My salesman told me plywood would fit and Plywood would fit in my sisterâs 2006 Sienna. But I learned that my seat automatically moves all the way back when the car is put in park. I did not know this because I always have the seat all the way back. The seat pressed the plywood against the rear hatch breaking the latch.  The mechanics could not get the hatch open. I had to leave the van at the dealership, plywood still inside until they could order a new latch. $750.  Toyota would not provide a loaner because they didnât want my two puppies in their cars. They did not have a shuttle so I had to wait 1 1/2 hrs for the parts cargo van to drive us home. Just a sad lack of customer service.",3.0,"Not a fan of this van.

 on 01/18/17 08:29 AM (PST),Floyd B ,2017 Toyota Sienna Minivan LE 8-Passenger 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Great Product," Toyota makes a great product and they did not fall short on the 2017 Sienna. I'm renting the LE fwd model and I'm surprised how easy this vehicle is to drive, park and how comfortable it feels on long and short distance drives. The shifts throw it's 8spd automatic transmission are smooth and quick under ECO mode. If you turn ECO mode off, the shift a ferm, but not harsh. The engine delivers good power(296hp on all trim levels...highest in its class with great fuel economy) but can be a bit loud under heavy load (fully acceleration with ECO mode on or off). The exterior of the Sienna is pleasing to the eye for most people. In higher trim levels, you can get fog lamps, lower body treatment and Altezza rear tail lights. The interior is an accommodating please to be. Comfortable seat front, middle and 3rd row. Driver gets a power adjustable seat with lumbar, while the others get manual siders. This model has the stoll-a-way second row middle seat which gives this Sienna the capability to seat 8 passangers. Great if you are an Uber driver. Super easy to see out of. This makes this van a little more affordable because, you don't really need the blind spot monitoring system, which I believe, it's offered on higher trim levels.

The shifts throw it's 8spd automatic transmission are smooth and quick under ECO mode. If you turn ECO mode off, the shift a ferm, but not harsh. The engine delivers good power(296hp on all trim levels...highest in its class with great fuel economy) but can be a bit loud under heavy load (fully acceleration with ECO mode on or off). The exterior of the Sienna is pleasing to the eye for most people. In higher trim levels, you can get fog lamps, lower body treatment and Altezza rear tail lights. The interior is an accommodating please to be. Comfortable seat front, middle and 3rd row. Driver gets a power adjustable seat with lumbar, while the others get manual siders. This model has the stoll-a-way second row middle seat which gives this Sienna the capability to seat 8 passangers. Great if you are an Uber driver. Super easy to see out of.

Based on great 1999 Camry experience, expected the Sienna to be better. So far, not so good. The main problem is the speedometer is wrong. It overstates speed 3-5 MPH. Our dealer in Tyson Corner, VA says it's normal and Toyota seems to agree. Granted, better than understating speed, but not what I expect of Toyota. Another surprise I didn't notice pre-purchase is that the 2nd row seats don't completely remove from the car. There is a substantial harness that remains above the floor. Wouldn't be able to carry drywall for example without damaging it. Never occurred to me to check after flat floors in past 3 minivans - Honda and Dodges. Buyer beware.Update 7/2016: still underwhelmed by the Sienna. We've managed to get used to compensating for the speedometer issue. We haven't had to haul a lot of cargo without the seats installed so the 'bump' hasn't caused a problem very often. I would add to the disappointments the sound system, especially with satellite audio as a source - it just doesn't sound very good at all. Keeping the car connected to my wife's iPhones (two different models so far) has been finicky at times. Toyota's choice to limit use of features like navigation while the car is in motion is frustrating. It had been helpful in previous cars for the front passenger to enter an address or look for a nearby restaurant, etc. while we were driving down a highway - that's not possible with the Sienna. So we find ourselves ignoring the car's systems in favor of using our smartphones - I suppose that's where everything is headed anyway. Other issues include significant road noise and a feeling of the engine being under powered at times. Ok, so enough complaining - what do I like? It has been reliable so far requiring only regularly scheduled maintenance, but that's what I expect. Overall, I imagine we'll be looking at a different brand next time.Update 1/2017: We're waiting on the fix to the power sliding door issue. For now, it's annoying to have to switch it to manual mode just to be safe. Still, reliability hasn't been bad. The major expense in the past 6 months has been replacing the tires. Our Toyota maintenance plan included with the original purchase has now expired so we'll need to pay out of pocket going forward. I'm still overall not real impressed with the Sienna. A particular annoying thing is the XM radio which we had to pay the dealer to install at the time of purchase. For whatever reason, that receiver is incapable of receiving a number of XM stations. E.g., ""Holiday Traditions"" which we always enjoyed in our former vans was on a channel this year that our receiver could not tune. Considering the XM radio was a $500 add on, this is very disappointing. The glitches with connecting the car to our iPhones has continued so that's not a great alternative. If I were to buy today, I would most likely go with the Pacifica.Update 7/2017: Power sliding door recall fix has just been made available, I am told.

Now let's talk about the cons;  The 1st was fine ....except that the brake pedal tended to slowly drop to the floor at times.  This was actually seen several times by the service reps.  Toyota refused to do a repair because the computer indicated nothing was wrong !  The new 2016 was bought in September, 2017, because of a terrific Toyota inventory clearance sale.

We purchased a certified used Toyota Siena from another dealer in 2007.  We purchase the van in anticipation of our soon arriving triplets.  In anticipation of their arrival we needed an automobile which could accommodate 4 car seats, one car seat for our one year old and 3 for our soon arriving triplets.  We found a Toyota Sienna that seemed to fit the bill.  While having lovely amenities like DVD system, heated seats, automatic doors, it has been one hazard after another.  In 2008, not quite a year after purchasing the certified pre-owned van, we were driving with our 4 young children, three nine month olds and a 17 month old, from Phoenix to Prescott in August.  While on highway 17 and 103 degrees outside our air conditioning went out without warning.  Our children were quickly overheating.  We stopped frequently to get wet cloths and ice to keep our children safe.  We took the van to Tim's Toyota.  The van had not more than one thousand miles beyond the 36,000 mile warranty.  The entire air conditioning system needed to be replaced and Tim's refused to offer any flexibility.  With less than one thousand miles over the warranty, they refused to offer any middle ground and we needed to pay for the new air conditioning system.  By the way, that system is now out again at 80,000 miles on the same vehicle.  We have had the automatic side doors fail three times.  Each time we have had to pay $1,800 - 2,000.  The first time the side door failed my children were being picked up from school.  The door failed to close when we stopped to get gas in route from school pick up to home.  I needed to drive with the children strapped in their seats while one side door did not close.  The dealership said ""this is a common problem with this model"" yet offered no middle ground, we paid to have the door fixed.  Two years later the opposite door had similar difficulties.  This week the original door with problems broke.  The automated system caused a cable to snap, which hit the window shattering it inside the vehicle.  It is a miracle that my children were not in the vehicle.  Had their been anyone seated other than in the front seats, those seated in the middle and back would have been seriously injured by the shattered glass that splintered through the car.  When we took the car to Tim's again we hear"" this is a common problem with this vehicle"".  Their suggestion was not have the door operate manually rather than paying the $1250.00 cost to fix the automatic door with certainty that the issue will happen again.  Their suggestion was to have the door operate manually for much less and reduce another malfunction of the same scale.  When the door broke and cable snapped glass was splintered all through the interior of the van.  In sum, this is unacceptable.  Do not buy this vehicle.  This vehicle is marketed and sold as a family and safe vehicle.  These are not true statements.  As a mother and consumer, I  am disappointed with Toyota.  The safety of my children have been jeopardized multiple times.  I find our local dealership to be less than helpful in issues they describe as"" common to the vehicle"".

 on 04/25/16 08:47 AM (PDT),Steve Machalek ,2016 Toyota Sienna Minivan XLE 8-Passenger 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),New Toyota guy, Prior to owning a Toyota sienna I owned a Honda Odyssey for 11 years.  There was always one thing that bugged me about my 2005 Odyssey.  There was a whistling noise that came through the front defroster vents when driving at high speeds.  I learned to live with it. Other than that the car was fantastic.   I am now the owner of a 2016 Toyota Sienna XLE 8 passenger. The car has been great.  I like the look of the vehicle  and it is comfortable and handles well.  I did notice one thing on this car that bugs me and I guess I'm going to have to live with it.  Every time I go over a bump there is a squeaking noise that comes from the rear drivers side seat.  I assume it happens because the 8th seat is not connected although I haven't checked that out yet.  99 percent of the time I will not be using the extra seat.  To be honest both the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey are about the same.  The reason I went with the Toyota Sienna was the outside appearance of the car and the interior layout.  Plus I think the idea of putting a vacuum it the Odyssey  was a stupid idea.  Waste of space.  In the Sienna you can store the extra seat in that space so you don't have to bring it in and out of the car when you want to use it.Update to Review:  This weekend I put the 8th seat (jump seat) in the car.  Squeaking stopped.  I'm not that happy that I'll have to listen to all that squeaking since I usually do not leave the extra seat in place.  Anybody else have the same issue?  It's been 2 years since owning this vehicle.  Still very happy.  The squeaking has to do with the rear passenger seat not locking into position very well.  I've learned to live with it.  I had an issue with the blind spot monitoring but it was fixed by Toyota at no charge during my last oil change.  The only thing I've noticed is a rubbing sound from the steering wheel when turning the wheel.  Sounds like a low moan.  Not that big a deal but I notice it.,4.0,New Toyota guy Prior to owning a Toyota sienna I owned a Honda Odyssey for 11 years.  There was always one thing that bugged me about my 2005 Odyssey.

Didn't have to give my right arm for it... Smells new. How many hybrid SUVs that can seat 7 and get 27 miles in the city do you know of? The kids love it and super quiet.Updated 2/17/2017, a year later: Wife and kids love it (I bought it for them). super quiet, great sound system, very comfortable and great on gas. Over all averages 25 miles per gallon. Things I've notice: very poor acceleration from a stop and if you punch the gas pedal, sometimes the engines rattles (more me than my wife).

I test drove many other cars from domestic and import manufacturers and decided that after my wife's good Corolla experience to mimic purchase. She has a 2014 with the CVT trans. Although in general I like the car for its hatch back, basic interior and reasonable road holding, driving this thing is the worst experience I have ever had. At 47 years old I have a CDL license and have owned and driven many cars, trucks, motorcycles and commercial vehicles with mostly good experiences. This car has some serious flaws with the manual trans and fuel programming which has made it dangerous for me to drive. For one thing it has an unstable idle at red lights. It will not settle down to about 750 RPMs, instead it roams from 400-800 and when it is dipped low I frequently stall it at lights trying to take off. Second, it has a hesitation off of idle which makes it difficult to feel for clutch engagement again when trying to take off from a stop. The result is either stalling again or slipping the clutch to the point I cannot see getting 50K out of this clutch. The fuel management is again flawed when accelerating beyond 3800k RPMs. This engine makes its highest torque at 4k and highest horsepower at about 5.4k. On my car when you hit 3.8k or higher RPMs the idle hangs at that RPM and will not lower for several seconds in between shifts. If you let the clutch out it makes the car jerk badly or you have to hold the clutch in until enough time evolves until the idle lowers to safely engage the higher gear. When trying to downshift there is great difficulty in revving the motor due to the  hesitation off of idle so again the car jerks badly due to too low of RPMs in the downshift. It has never produced any fault codes for these issues. When brought in for service the dealership here in Albuquerque, NM downplayed the issues by claiming it runs the same as another new car on the lot. Currently my car has 1.3k on it, it's not even broken in by a long shot. As others have noted the engine is extremely low powered and I feel well below the stated 136 HP and 126 Torque ratings. I did not buy it for as a sports car for sure. The brakes are somewhat spongy but according to the dealership all is well again compared to some other car. In retrospect I wish that I had not purchased this vehicle as there is no way I will be able to solve the fuel programming and idle issues  on my own and the lifespan of the clutch and transmission will be severely short lived due to Toyota's design.",2.0,"What a Lemon I bought this new 5/17 with a 6 speed manual.

It's made in Japan, and I've found through experience that that's a plus. It has the practicality of a hatchback but the styling and handling of a sportier car. I've been surprised by how well it handles -- also by the number of standard features, including backup camera,  lane change monitoring, forward collision monitoring, automatic headlights (with manual override), decent audio system, dual control heating/cooling system, bluetooth, USB port, height-adjustable driver's seat, sporty low profile tires with nice looking alloy wheels . . . and more. I like the analog speedometer and tachometer. Other reviewers are correct in saying that it's not a particularly powerful car, but with the manual transmission, power is sufficient (and the manual is more fun to drive).  Gas mileage is good, though not as good as some other small cars. The CVT gets considerably better gas mileage than the manual, mostly because the manual doesn't have a really tall 6th gear -- at 75 mph the manual (6th gear) is turning at 3000 rpm while the CVT is at 2000 (I drove a CVT as a rental car.)  So, it's not a performance car, but it handles very well, and it lasts forever. Not a bad tradeoff. Downsides? I'm 5'10"" and  I find that getting in and out of the car is less comfortable than on other cars I've owned due to the car's low profile -- you sit low and the car itself has sporty low ground clearance. The driver's seat lacks lumbar support (I use a small pillow to compensate). The lane change monitoring system uses a sensor housed in a small enclosure mounted behind the rear-view mirror -- this has a minor but negative effect on how much of a panorama you get out the windshield. The forward collision avoidance system works well, but lane change monitoring is overly sensitive, even though it can be adjusted. The automatic headlight option works ok, though it has trouble at night managing the brights. The 6 speed manual's clutch/accelerator coordination requires more practice than usual to get used to because the accelerator is a bit over sensitive and the clutch's friction point a bit narrow -- I'm guessing the accelerator is designed for the CVT. This affects manual shifting dexterity somewhat -- not a deal breaker, but something to notice. The 6 speed manual transmission is ok, though not as slick shifting as, for example,  a Mazda 3 (I've compared them). For the money, I think the car is very good. If you want to spend $5,000 to $10,000 more, you can get better performance, but nothing will beat the Corolla IM in mechanical reliability or resale value.

I only have a few complains and these are very minor in scope.  First, the doors are huge and you must always be aware of how close you park to the car next to you.  Second and lastly, when it rain water drips down form where the convertible top meets the windshield pillar.  This leads to water dripping on your clothes in an unflattering manner.

The idea of a Corolla doesn't appeal to me whatsoever- but my dad (as most dads would feel) thought a Corolla would be a perfect car for me as a newbie driver. I 'lucked out' when a family member sold us their car and ended up with a little Mazda 3 that turned out to be a lemon, then my second car- a 4000lb land yatcht- a 2008 V6 Convertible Sebring that I put a lot of love into and learned how to park backwards due to it's 19' length.  5 years later (without any crashes or tickets) I can say I've gained some perspective for wanting to purchase a reliable car. Still, the matter remained that I wanted a car I could have FUN in. I don't want a cage- I want an experience, something with a little luxury- after all, I have to drive it to work and school through traffic- might as well enjoy it. Well I have to say, for a limited budget this car certainly fits the bill :) so I ended up trading my old land yacht in for a 2006 Toyota Solara Convertible SLE. If I had to compare it to other cars in the way it drives, I would say it's a combination of my dad's little black convertible CLK 320 and a larger sedan. It's no rocket, so don't expect pep- but it's as smooth as butter when it drives and offers a modest amount of acceleration in traffic. The first time I smashed the gas pedal I actually heard the V6 roar! The interior isn't particularly stunning- after all it's a 2006 model. Still, it offers a nice array of creature comforts, heated front seats, loudly annoying back-up sensors, auto-climate control (that's ICE cold), auto-light shut off (in case you leave your headlights on), DRL, auto-adjusting rear-view mirrors, etc. But it lacks a proper stereo-system, and there really are no modern substitutes except for the auxillary port work-around that has to be installed with some technical know-how (thank you dad).  The biggest flaw in this car (imo) is the terrible blind-spots it has. Unless you're used to driving a convertible where the back window is often small and round, then prepare to adjust your driving style accordingly. I got used to it after a couple of days and now use my side-mirrors to navigate (along with those corner blind-spot mirrors). For some reason the designers brilliantly decided to put a raised bench seat in the back of the car and the headrests (along with any guests' heads) will ensure that you have 0 visibility when checking your back. It can be terrifying if you're not an attentive driver and try to make a lane change without triple checking your side mirrors and making a quick head-turn. But aside from that I really have no qualms with how it drives. My dad (who had driven this car for a while before trading it with me) noticed it had a bit of hesitance when it accelerated. When you hit the gas pedal, it was 1..2..*accelerates* Well he did some research and after cleaning the mass air-flow sensor, and the throttle body we both agreed it accelerates incredibly well now. It's very responsive!! I have to be careful because I don't even notice how fast I'm going- it drives so smoothly and accelerates so quickly. It's a far-cry from the clunky-chunky toss around the Sebring is. I'm so pleased with this car :) it's at 125,000 and since the previous owner was a meticulous guy he had already replaced the timing belt, water pump, convertible top, and got the recall on the dash which is now a new leather dash. He's definitely a keeper, and I feel very confident and safe driving this car. Not to mention the top is mechanic so there's NO noise and fuss when it goes down! <3 How great is that?? Much better than the expensive hydraulic top the Sebring has (which popped like an old man getting out of bed). One other issue (that has since been taken care of) was that these models' tops have been known to leak over time due to the piping in the trunk breaking  that serves as a gutter for water to run off the top when it rains. My dad spent $200 getting the top sewn up by a upholsterer. He took it to the shop with the back bench removed and the guy went in there and fixed it all up. So I would strongly suggest that before you buy one of these cars (especially if it's over 100,000) make sure it was very well taken care of! That the dash was replaced, and that the timing belt and water-pump were already replaced thus sparing you the extra headache down the line. Prepare to possibly repair that top though as it's a design flaw of the Solara in whole. Expect to spend $500-$1000 fixing it up in general on top of the sticker price because of it's age, including adding to the sound system and making it modern-day functional.

I have changed the coolant several times and the radiator is still in good shape.  I have changed the spark plugs about every 100,000 miles and they have always looked clean.  The coils are original.  The car uses about a quart of oil between 5,000-mile oil changes and I think some/most of that may be due to a worn cam or crank seal leak.  I plan to change those seals during the next timing belt replacement.  The check-engine light is on and probably due to a bad O2 sensor.  The engine runs great and idles very smooth at 800 rpm.

 on 02/11/16 21:16 PM (PST),Tom H ,2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Great Car for the Money despite some shortcomings.," Recently test drove a used 2013 Avalon Hybrid XLE Touring, New 2015 Avalon Hybrid Limited & New 2016 Avalon Hybrid Limited. We purchased the 2015 Avalon Hybrid Limited with 0% financing for 60mos. & traded a 2011 Hyundai Sonata Limited. I really noticed very little difference in the 2016 model in comfort & ride and the pricing on the 2015 we purchased was phenomenal - $34k before tax.Being a bit OCD & a heavy researcher/review reader before taking the plunge on a new vehicle it should be know that there are definitely some trade-offs with the Avalon.First off, the driver seat is much reviewed for being uncomfortable...especially on longer rides. On the Limited model, there is 10 way adjustability...I initially experienced this weird ""I love the seat but can't fully get comfortable"" feeling when first driving. But, after taking some time to really tweak the settings on the driver seat - I found my happy spot. The 2015 Avalon Hybrid drivers seat reminds me of some of my old BMW Sport Package seats. The seats aren't Cadillac plush, they're definitely more BMW ""luxury/sport"" seats. The ride isn't as soft as the old Cadillacs were but it's close. I can say it's a more sporty ride (you feel more road) but with a quiet cabin & Hybrid gas conservation. When you're on nice interstate or highway pavement - they can floats like a dream. On harsh roads, you will definitely get some feedback in the driving experience.Gas Mileage: Window sticker states 40/39. I am still trying to play with my driving & using the ECO setting to get these numbers. I love the fact a vehicle this big has better than average pickup, has 600+ mile range on a tank of gas and averages in the mid to high 30's in mpg's. Being that I am driving in the current winter cold of Chicago, I wonder how the Spring/Summer warmer weather will affect the gas mileage. Overall, I am still pleased with what I am seeing in gas mileage.Pricing: These cars definitely can be found for bargain basement pricing. Essentially a Lexus, minus a wood grained, heated steering wheel, etc. But for about $10k less coupled with Toyota reliability - this is the part for me that sold me. I can live with some minor annoyances for the fact most Toyota's will see 200k if maintained. The initial depreciation is steep on these cars if you pay sticker (but most can be picked up for under invoice if you shop a bit). Used 13-15 Avalon Hybrids tend to be priced in the $23-30k range used depending on mileage. Electronics/Entune/Navigation: THE BAD: Being that I own a 2008 Toyota Sequoia Limited & 2013 Toyota Prius - I already knew the Toyota navigation system was garbage. Directions are just bad/wrong. The fact you can't do anything on the touch screen while moving is a huge annoyance. Directions themselves are garbage & what takes me 3 minutes to input a location (again, while completely stopped) on the Avalon Nav system I can simply open my Google Maps on my iPhone, speak my destination & have guidance up in 20 seconds. I don't understand how these car manufacturers are so far behind the curve on this. The Entune app is also awful! The functionality works 10% of the time. Lastly, I am experiencing issues with Bluetooth music skipping when streamed from my iPhone...I haven't fully investigated this yet but never had this issue in my Prius?THE GOOD: Lots of bells & whistles to play with and customize. The Audio is very crisp & clear on the 11 speaker JBL speakers on the Limited model. The Auto heat is perfect. Front & Rear Heated seats are great. Rear Sunshade is very nice for kids in the backseat. I love the blind spot detection, rain sensing wipers & HID headlights. Great night visibility.Small annoyances: Engine can be a bit sluggish/hesitant when driving between ECO/Power...like the engine can't quite make up it's mind. It's subtle but admittedly annoying.Radio setup/presets are confusing. Why give a driver the option to choose FM/AM/XM if presets for each don't change/come up?MPG: Hoping there's a little driving learning curve as Toyota numbers have always, in my experience, been as advertised. I'd like to see at least 37/38 going forward. But, again, this is a big sedan that moves well that I'm complaining about getting 36.5 currently...kind of an oxymoron as cars this size normally didn't ever approach these MPG numbers prior to the advent of the hybrid engine.Last, but not least, what I LOVE about the Avalon:The drive. Some hate it, but I think its sporty & refined.The gas mileage. The roominess, trunk space, all the little bells & whistles.Number 1 Love: The bang for the buck! I think this is a car that flies under the radar with most buyers. You don't see a ton on the road as the senior market who owned the Avalon's prior to the 2013 redesign apparently were put off by the new firmer ride.

 on 11/26/16 15:05 PM (PST),S S ,2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid Sedan XLE Touring 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Mixed review," Having been a Toyota owner now since the late 90s I unfortunately have to say that things have been going down hill as far as my experience with Toyota and this Avalon. I have had more little issues come with this car than the total of all my other Toyotas. So I'll start with the issues. 1) The tires, Bridgestone Turanzas are by far the worst tires I've ever had. I finally got rid of them at 17k. Increasingly noisy, poor traction, very harsh ride, like stones. I test drove an Avalon with the Michelins on it and they were much better. My car was located and I had no idea these poor quality tires existed until driving this care for a few weeks. I replaced them with Pirelli P7s and they are much better tires on this car. 2) The headliner started falling down around the rear of the sunroof. The dealer attempted the first fix from Toyota and succeeded in getting fingerprints all over the headliner. This is not to be confused with the headliners falling down near the rear window on the 2013s, this is another issue. The second time I took it back Toyota had come up with another fix and it worked, and the dealer succeeded in getting finger prints all over the headliner and complained about having to clean them off because the tech had used gloves and he couldn't have done it? Well at least that defect if finally fixed. 3) The chrome trim at the bottom of the rear passenger driver's side window started lifting up. You can push it down, but it comes back up if you raise the window. The dealer said they'd call when they get the replacement, haven't heard in over a month. I'll need to remind them. 4) The vinyl on the armrest is cracking on a corner. Toyota uses vinyl all over on these leather interiors FYI. The cracking is occurring on a sharp wrap around surface where you don't even touch it. The vinyl material surface is flaking off. Others on the TN website are reporting the same issue but much worse in some cases. Toyota did replace the armrest under warranty. 5) The radio just dies in AM or FM mode. You can move from station to station (as if in mute) but no sound. If you stop the car and re-start it's fine. And of course the dealer is unable to help since it only does it once in a while.  So that's my list of issues at 20,000 miles.   The negatives you will want to make sure you are OK with on these cars 1) Harsh ride, better tires help but Toyota seems to think people want a car that rides harsh and handles so-so instead of a car that rides nice and handles so-so. 2) The seats are pretty firm and as time goes on you feel like you are riding on the seat frames. Poor design for comfort. 3) The power lumbar is very poor, the adjustment is very limited and it's hard to find a comfortable position. My 2012 Camry was much better. 4) The NAV unit is absolutely horrible. Unfortunately Toyota sticks you with this NAV and mediocre stereo. The NAV updates are near $200 and only available once a year. If you ask the dealer, they don't seem to know much about it. I use my iPhone most of the time it's much more intuitive, roads are updated constantly, and the GUI is much simpler.   5) The Entune firmware is like something from the early 2000s. It's horribly slow, and the Bluetooth setup needs to be re-paired every now and then since it gets messed up. Toyota has really fallen behind with this firmware, the apps are ancient and my iPhone blows it away, yet my iPhone can't interface with the display. There is all these harassing screen warnings that I eventually figured out to disable for the most part, but I now rarely use it since it's so dated compared to phone apps. Most people I know with Toyotas rarely use their NAVs or Entune, if ever. So the likes 1) MPG, MPG, MPG incredible. For a full size car it's hard to believe you can get 40-45mpg with a little finessing and attention to mpg increasing techniques. 2) The drivetrain is great. The Toyota Hybrid Drive System is flawless so far and the transitions between Electric and ICE drive is hard to notice. The ECVT transmission has no shift points and is smooth as butter. The drive power delivery is quiet and smooth. 3) I like the brakes, they have a balanced amout of effort stopping power. 4) Steering is precise and well balanced as far as effort and road feel for a car this size. The steering wheel design is also great. Very comfortable. 5) The exterior is attractive IMO as is the interior. Great aesthetic design again IMO. So the bottom line is the 2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid Touring is a very nice looking car inside and out with an excellent proven Hybrid drive train that delivers excellent MPG for a car this size. Where it falls down is the harsh ride, firm seat bottoms, poor interior quality material (vinyl), and some pesky quality fails at 20k.",3.0,"Mixed review Having been a Toyota owner now since the late 90s I unfortunately have to say that things have been going down hill as far as my experience with Toyota and this Avalon.

We upgraded from a pop up camper to a 21' hybrid that when loaded approaches 5,000#. In a strong crosswind it tossed the FJ around like a rag doll, due to the very short wheelbase and high ride height. White knuckle driving at any speed above 50 mph was the result. We quickly traded it in on a Toyota Tundra and you'd hardly even know the camper is back there.

Best decision I ever made for a car couple years ago. To emulate Charlton Heston, ""You will only get my Prius out of my cold dead hands."" She just turned 115,000 miles and the only things I've changed to date is the oil and I think they change the air filter as part of the regular service, but I'm not sure.

The cars are immaculate in terms of just about everything. But do remember- this is a car from 2002 and will have different interior and what not from cars today. The first generation Prii are just about as good as you can get. Over the 2 I have had, I constantly average about 48 MPG. 44 @ 70+, 55 @ 55+, 55 @ 30-55 MPH. The headlights do SUCK on these! But that is nothing that cannot be fixed with about $30, Amazon, and something called XENON headlights that will light up the road. Costs $30 and takes about 20 minutes to set up. I want to make something clear to those who say the repair costs are tremendous: you are wrong! If the main hybrid battery were to fail, the cost is NOT $2000+. I repair 2000-2009 Prius hybrid batteries as a side job all the time. I personally buy working used batteries with less than 120k miles on the for between $200 and $500 and it takes less than an HOUR to replace yourself or if you find a shop, or if you chose to have someone replace it, then expect around $300 to install. On average I charge $700 to replace the hybrid battery completely- that's the cost of EVERYTHING. If you want a new battery and want Toyota to install it personally, then of course expect a couple thousand- what did you expect for a car that was $20,000 when it first came out? That's like buying a brand new engine from GMC when your head gasket goes out. I mean seriously? Use your brain! Not only this, but the hybrid battery almost never fails entirely- it is usually a couple of cells which cost less than $40 and I charge less than $70 each to replace. Shop around at your local shop, replacing the battery is actually simple. For those of you who are willing to learn, look a video on youtube of how to change a prius hybrid battery. My first time took me 50 minutes. Takes about a full hour after you put extra features that will protect the newly installed battery. Not only this, but you can RECYCLE the bad battery for about $150 and that's the price I buy the bad batteries at(which can be repaired by simply replacing cells). I also drive this car on average around 40,000 miles a year because I travel so often. This is a review from someone who not only has 3 total cars that are 1st-3rd generation Prii and not a single other type of car and who works on them and learned by himself.

We go everywhere in this thing (wife and 4 kids).  The Pros: It is a Toyota with great resale value, 0 mechanical problems than regular maintenance (oil changes, brakes and tires), comfortable interior for the entire family, LOTS of cubby hole storage hidden all over this car, handles great on sunny/rainy/snowy days (I feel very comfortable with my wife taking a drive in the snow with the kiddos in this SUV).  For the 4 cyl engine, it has a higher tow capacity than any other comparable SUV I have found.  The Cons: Not really much to say here though have two very minor things to comment on: 1) the reverse camera does not allow you to toggle for directional tracking of where your car will be with the angle of the wheels.  This is a very handy feature to have that is missing here. 2) The USB plug barely charges your phone.  As this overrides the BT function of the radio and phone, your music and such are fed through the USB, but your battery will still drain.  Leaving BT on and having my iPhone plugged in on a 2hr drive my phone lost 23% battery life instead of charging.  Road performance.  I have driven Toyota's many times in my life and am a huge fan of the Rav.  It has a peppy pickup and go from stop or while in motion.  Sometimes (especially in my town where speed limit is often 25mph) maybe a little too much pep?  I find myself taking my foot off the gas very quickly to coast and ride the brake time to time in residential areas.  The visibility for the driver can hardly be beat than with the Rav.  Very few blind spots.  A U-turn does require a little more than a standard 2 lane road with the expansion of the wheel base, but still, for the extra foot length of the car to its predecessor, I'll make the swap.  Road noise is there but not bad at all.  You feel the road without feeling like you are being beaten to death by it, lol.  A smooth ride in a vehicle that can still hug curves at decent rates without squealing tires.  Interior comfort.  My kids have plenty of leg room in the back, and if the front passenger and driver are willing to give up a very little bit of theirs, adults can be in the backseat comfortably.   The cup holders for front and back are well placed, and the seats are comfortable.  Personally i feel the front seats have a bit more padding in them for the rump than the back seats.  As I am a bigger guy and my knees don't like me squatting into and out of sedans much any more, I find the access very easy without having to climb up and in.   The back area of the car with the rear seat up is quite large for a small SUV.  My Mastiff ( a 160lb dog) fits back there comfortably.  If I need both of my dogs to go somewhere, then the seats have to be folded down.  Gas MPG is decent for an SUV with AWD.  Before we moved to the mountains we were getting approx 26 in city and 32 on highway.

That being said, my Escape had more options on it for the price point.  I have never owned a Toyota before and I found the appearance of the RAV4 inviting.  The 2017 RAV4's only offer a 4 cylinder engine, the 2016's offered a 6 cylinder.  The SE comes with the ECO/Sport modes.  ECO I'm getting about 29mpg, Sport mode close to the same, although engine is more peppy in sport mode.  There is plenty of power for merging onto highways and for passing in my opinion.  Interior is quiet and road/engine noise into the cabin is minimal.  The SE's suspension is more stiff, a little more rough than I'd like but ok.  Almost no vehicle lean going around corners, electric steering feels fine also.  Stereo is great!  Cabin speakers more than adequate, better than my Escape's.  The seats are not as comfortable as I would have expected, a bit disappointing!  The headlights and tail lights have the LED trim which looks very nice.  Great visibility at night with just low beams on!  Back seat is spacious, cargo area fine.  The only thing I wish I had is memory button for drivers seat and a power passenger seat.  Other than that it's a nice vehicle, but I only have a little over 550 miles on it so far.I've had my Rav4 now for 13 months....accumulating 32K miles on it so far.  Here is what I think now about it.  The front cup holders are in terrible locations, I've spilled drinks due to this, very irritating!  The seats , front and back, could use more padding, not comfortable on long drives.  Big problems are night driving, not all buttons are lit!  You better know where they are in the dark!  The dash lights only go so bright, not enough for me...and it appears not for others reviewing this vehicle either.  The steering wheel needs to tilt more and telescope further out. Those are the negatives!  The gas mileage is great for an AWD, I average 27 in the Winter and 29 in the Summer.  Legroom/headroom is very good, I'm 6'-4"" and 260 lbs. and I have no issues.  Cargo space is good also.  It handles very driving in the snow also.  The safety features saved me several times from accidents, and I consider myself an attentive driver.

My red 2008 Toyota Rav4 4x4 took the cake, icing, and the cherry on top. This year, make, and model have the perfect balance of appearance, reliability, versatility, comfort, and an old school/new school blend of instrumentation. 2008 was one of the last years to have the full-sized, alloy-rimmed spare on the back and side-opening trunk, small features that make the experience of owning this RAV4 all the better. Toyota has a rock-solid reputation for longevity with little-to-no problems; this 2008 RAV4 is no exception. The only problem that arose among many owners was burning oil, which Toyota dealerships fully cover. The backseats lay down completely flat, something almost no other crossovers can say, not to mention the extra cargo compartments under the enormous trunk due to the spare wheel on the back. The 2008 RAV4 has legroom for days and plenty of room to lounge in the reclining backseat. I love my simple dash and instrument panel. No bright distracting screens, no millions of buttons and presets for things you'll use in the first week of owning and never use again, just classic warning lights, mileage, temp outside, AUX input, and ice-cold air.

I needed a fuel efficient, roomy, do-it-all car for my daily commute, driving the kids, and something my partially disabled wife could drive, too.  I put about 9,000 miles on the SUV since I bought it used in January, including a couple days of central Maryland snow.  So far, this RAV4 does everything well enough and nothing spectacularly.Performance is adequate.  The 2.5 liter four-banger has enough power for my commute and in-town driving.  Highway merges aren't a problem as long as I'm willing to gun it hard.  The power is barely adequate with three passengers and highway merging is dicey.  My overall fuel economy is a pretty good 27 MPG.  Braking is effective.  The long pedal travel was disconcerting enough that I had the dealer re-check the brakes.  The brakes work well under all conditions once I got the feel of them.The car holds the road suprisingly well, much better than I expected from an SUV.  The steering is predictable and solid.  The four-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and the gear changes are merely noticeable, even under hard acceleration.  I hardly notice them any more.Front seat comfort is okay.  I'm 6'4"" and weigh about 310 pounds.  Leg room is sufficient and I have plenty of headroom, about three inches.  I wish the seat had better thigh support.  The seat cushions are very firm, almost hard.  The side bolsters hold me in place nicely, even during hard curves and corners.  All of my drive times have been shorter than an hour.  I have no information about longer trips.The rear seat is surprisingly roomy.  Teenagers (up to 5'8"") can sit behind me and still have enough room to be comfortable.  I could sit behind me and have enough room!  The rear seat cushions are as firm as the front seat cushions.  However, my teenaged rear seat passengers ride for short trips and haven't complained.My main interior complaint is the frikkin' noise!  A lot of engine and tire noise penetrate the cabin.  Road noise is so bad that I can't listen to the radio.  I stopped playing the radio during my commute lest my ears ring painfully at the end of the trip.Cargo and storage is cavernous.  I love it!  I'm glad the first owner did not get the optional third row seat.  There are plenty of pockets, cubbies, and other cavities for small things.  The cavernous cargo space is a boom box, though.  I think half of the road noise is amplified back there.Safety seems fine.  If I don't notice, then it's probably good, right?  The headlights are nice and bright.  The all-wheel drive, anti-skid control, and anti-lock brakes worked unobtrusively or as expected in the snow.  Win!This RAV4 is my first car to have Bluetooth.  I don't know how I lived without it! I have one USB port and one 3.5mm headphone jack in the Base trim.  The radio sounds okay for playing speech but lousy for music.  It's the cheap base model radio and it sucks.  I don't know if I would notice a better radio over the aforementioned interior noise, though.  Reliability?  Maintenance costs?  It's a Toyota!  It gets top reviews and recommendations everywhere.  This is the fifth Toyota in my family and all previous Toyotas have been rock solid.

First, the interior of the base model is very good in my opinion. The front seats in this car are very comfortable they hug your sides even if you are of a more slender build. The leg room in the front seats is very good. I'm six feet tall, and there is still more room to move the seat back. The back seats have decent leg room as well, I would be comfortable riding in the back seats of this car for a long car trip. Storage in this car is also very good. I use this vehicle to carry music gear to all of my shows. I can fit a 4x8 bass cabinet, 2 guitar amps, 6 guitars, a six way guitar stand, a few effects pedals, mics and stands. With all of this there is still enough room to comfortably fit 3 people in the vehicle. 2 in the front, one in the 40 split in the back seat. The performance of this car is solid. I would not call this car fast, cause it's not, but the engine has plenty of power to merge on the highway, and move in and out of traffic. The steering on this car is also very good. It is light when making parking maneuvers, but tightens up when cornering more aggressively. I drove this car in the snow/ice this winter and it does fairly well. The traction control system is surprisingly good and getting the car to grip up in worse than ideal conditions.  Visibility in this car is good, The back window is harder to see out of then I would like, but the back up camera comes as standard in this vehicle, which is pretty useful. The mirrors are excellent with the blind spot mirrors in the corners, there is virtually no blind spot when adjusted correctly. The transmission is fairly good, but I honestly just don't like automatic transmissions coming from driving a 5 speed for 6 years before this car.  The Bluetooth in the car works very well for playing music I don't use it for much else. The text reading options kind of suck and the menus for the screens though logical take too many steps, but I'm driving a car so I usually don't mess with them any how. The steering wheel has a nice feel to it and the controls don't clutter it up too much. Fuel economy is good in this car. I usually get about 26 mpg when I fill up, that is usually mostly city driving and I tend to be a faster driver in general so I think that is pretty good. As for the quality of the interior, I would say it is good, I have black cloth seats, and they look nice, and the fabric breathes quite well, so even in hot Kentucky summers the car isn't unbearably warm. No mechanical issues with this car so far, it was a rental car that had 42k miles on it when I bought it so I figured it lived a tough life before I got it, but seems to have suffered no damage during that time.

Like many, I bought the car because I have a very outdoorsy lifestyle, i.e. frequent trips to trails, forest roads, etc. The Rav simply could not keep up; the suspension design is AWFUL--it slams over bumps and feels very bouncy and unstable. There were frequent rattles from the cheap plastic on the interior, which drove me nuts, and the AWD was sub par at best. I would not recommend this vehicle for anyone who likes to venture outside of city limits. Unfortunately, I also believe that the brake system is flawed- they often felt ""spongey"" and unresponsive.

Emergency handling is great as I unfortunately had the experience of finding out.

The EPA estimates of 23 city and 30 highway were lower than actual mileage. I regularly get 26 mpg city and easily 38 mpg highway. It should be noted that I drive gently with a light foot on the pedal.    The technology takes some time to master especially the navigation system, it is confusing at times, too many options, and when vehicle is in motion many options are grayed out and are unusable not only in navigation but other apps as well.  My wife could not enter a point of interest in navigation where we wanted to stop on the way without pulling over to a complete stop. Toyota dropped the ball on this system and I would recommend not wasting your money and buying an aftermarket hand held unit such as a Garmin instead.  The load floor at the rear is low making it easy to load heavy items and the cargo area is huge for a compact.

I was even able to put a Washing Machine in it (and still closed the doors)!  Hands down the most reliable, convenient, easiest car I have ever owned.  If it keeps on 'truckin', it will be the car I teach all 3 of my girls how to drive.  There are ZERO blind spots.  I have often joked that is it a 'fish bowl on wheels'.  Maintenance costs have been minimal.  My husband is a mechanic and he is in awe about the lack of attention he needs to give my car.  Brakes are STILL THE ORIGINALS!  (Take that, Bay Area traffic!)!  It blew a head gasket about 3 years ago and he pulled it out and took it to a machine shop to have it fixed.  The guys at the shop commented on the shape of the engine and that we should, 'keep this car forever'.  I will.  I know it will hit 400k within the next few months but I'm already looking at 500k!  The only issue I have with it (and boy is it a minor issue) is the cup holders.  They are placed just below the CD player (that I never use, but I digress) and they are too small for your standard commuter coffee cup.  They will hold a coffee cup from any take out place but they holder are very shallow.  The cups wobble and may lead to a mocha spilling directly into the CD player (it happened...it wasn't pretty...I don't use the CD player anyway).  I wedge my commuter cup in between the passenger seat and the e-brake if I need to set it down.

Great tech in the Audi but all data on reliability and the data was was limited to 7 years.  Great tech in the Volvo XC90 but when you think of a 4 cylinder with a turbo charger and supercharger it is still a 4 cylinder engine pushing out that power and the strain it puts on the components is high.  Range Rover also beautiful and technologically advanced but I own a Jaguar already and don't need 2 high maintenance vehicles (don't get me wrong I like the smooth V8 but I keep my trucks a long time).  I had a 1999 Isuzu Trooper and it finally gave out after 18 years.  The Toyota Land Cruiser delivers smooth power quietly and the ride absorbs the bumps without jarring occupants, but keep in mind it is a truck.  Cabin is well insulated and keeps out the noise.  The fuel efficiency is less than desireable, recent 1200 mile road road trip I averaged 17.5 mpg (I-5 through northern CA).  In the city if I adjust my driving style can get 13.5 MPG.  Only maintenance I have had done is get the windshield replaced, on the road trip got a rock chip.  I have $0 deductible (lucky I switched), OEM glass is $900 and install another $200-300.  Then you have to get the sensors and cameras calibrated at the dealership which is another $130-180.

I grew up a car guy, into exotic sports cars, and always laughed at the Prius. Previous models looked ugly. When it came time to buy my first new car, all of a sudden, practicality set in and I wanted to make a smart purchase. The tax credit appealed to me, and so didn't the tech. Working in manufacturing, I appreciate and respect Toyota's manufacturing processes and felt I would be better off getting a well-built, reliable car with the Toyota over other brands. I also liked the fact that Toyota seems to always take care of their customers in the event of recalls. I remember my aunt getting a new truck when her frame had rusted on her T100. If there was going to be any problems with the car, I wanted to give my business to a manufacturer that would make things right with me, the buyer. I was also really attracted to the looks of the Prime - I don't believe I'm that crazy to say the front end looks similar to Acura's new NSX supercar. My first impression was great - the handling and power (especially with a charge in power mode) surprised me. I had an Audi A4 with Quattro AWD before, so the handling in winter (New Hampshire) wasn't as good as my Audi, but that's to be expected. I also don't like the glare on the touchscreen or how easily the acrylic front bumper chips and cracks. I literally have a hole in mine from a rock that kicked up. When I went to fix this, I found out that it is only sold as the entire grille sub-assembly for $550, so I drive around with a hole in my bumper now. To see what I'm talking about, I filmed this to show: https://youtu.be/dLOSR0gQ84M . The ground clearance is also really low which I think makes it look good, but I've scrapped my bumper multiple times so if you have a steep driveway or go over speedbumps often, consider the ground clearance. The low ground clearance also makes it get stuck in the snow easily. I don't have a garage so after a snowstorm, the snow will pack underneath the car and make it nearly impossible to get unstuck. If you have a charge, it defaults to EV mode too, which will not allow the wheels to spin, so you press the accelerator to try getting unstuck, and literally nothing happens. It is extremely frustrating. If you live where there is snow, make sure you plow or shovel a path. I no longer charge mine though, because it is less expensive for me to run on gasoline than to charge it (I have flat-rate electric rates, so I can't take advantage of off-peak hours). If you have flat-rates too, do the math to figure out what makes most sense, do not assume that plugging in will save you money. Plugging in or not, its still a great car and I have averaged 52 mpg over 24,000 miles, nearly all of which were in hybrid mode with no charge. I also drive on the interstate to and from work so that's also at highway speeds. When I tried to get good fuel economy on a recent 317 mile road trip, I was able to get 77.3 mpg without a charge: https://youtu.be/8fAm7YuebWU .

 on 08/02/15 17:10 PM (PDT),Roger B. ,2012 Toyota Prius v Wagon Five 4dr Wagon (1.8L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Good Value and Reliability," Update of the review at 61,600 miles and 5 1/2 years old: If you don't want to drive a SUV but need carrying space this is a viable candidate.  Still trouble free. The accessories and switchgear operate like day one.  The ""Destination Look Up"" in the Entune suite isn't too user-friendly, especially through the microphone. Best to pull over and type in a destination, although it's cumbersome.  The Bluetooth on this car operates very well, it's clear and the signal is not interrupted. It will announce smartphone audible map instructions, interrupting any playing music (however the smartphone's map is not on the car's screen).  Overall economy is at 47MPG.  Generally the MPG can be around 45 to 51mpg in warm weather and 38 to 45mpg in the winter, subject to the length of the trip and it's speed. Short runs of a few miles will only get to 38 to 45mpg. So if you don't have many long distance runs it will take you longer to get a return on the purchase of a hybrid.  I haven't owned any premium vehicles but this one feels premium to me, quieter and more comfortable-riding then some other economy cars.  A couple months ago I had the navigation updated. That required three visits to the dealer as they were sent USB drives which wouldn't install on the first two attempts. To summarize, I think this car's tech is still pretty contemporary, also reliability and economy are excellent.  There are very few high-roof wagons or hatches (not CUV or SUV) that are similar (a couple of the Subarus or the VW Sportwagen).Updated review at 56,000 miles:The car has continued to be trouble-free. At the 50,000 mile dealer service I had to install front brake pads and turn the rotors. At 38,000 miles new tires were installed, Goodyear Eagles, LRR (Low Rolling Resistance). After installation of the tires the mpg dropped, but as they got cut in the miles-per-gallon came back to normal. In the summer, with no high speed runs, there have been a few tanks of fuel  over 50 mpg (with the right conditions).  Short local trips however will produce high 30s to low 40s mpg readings. I have an average lifetime for the vehicle of just over 46mpg (measured by math on each fill, not the car's meter). I do have a frequent city trip around 30 miles in distance which really lets the hybrid system show it's economy. The technology is good, bluetooth works well and the Toyota Entune system includes Pandora, Slacker Radio, IHeart Radio, Stocks, Weather and Sports scores. In addition I can also stream Spotify or play from a USB drive.  The navigation is the first one I've had, so all I can say is that it works ok, but it's now almost 5 years old. So i did encounter one intersection which had been rebuilt:  it did not coordinate with the stored navigation map.The overall drive experience is pleasant and quiet when cruising along or under light to moderate acceleration. There is engine noise on hard acceleration. The cargo room is extraordinary, there are fold flat front seats too. The seats are very comfortable, I have the Five with the artificial ""leather."" They are very comfortable on long trips.Update at 67,500 miles:  Dealer had to install new clips and free up the rear left caliper. It was not working well (they said) due to road debris, salt etc. This was discovered on their normal inspection when in for service.  Otherwise only normal tire and front pad replacements thus far.

It RUINS the Toyota experience!  If I had known how bad that system and the Entune 3.0 was, I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS CAR!   First, upon linking to the system, it downloaded almost ONE Gigabit of Data!  I don't use my phone for data, and that cost me another $15 on top of my phone bill!   The Scout GPS system takes FOREVER to load, and will not show a map when you are driving around.  You HAVE to put in a destination!  I tried - really, tried very hard - to learn the system and give it a fair shake, but the hare-brained good-idea fairy that came up with the Entune and Scout GPS should be FIRED!  In my small town, I live a whole 4 miles from the park where the farmers' market is held.  I have a choice - take a two lane state highway, or take the two-lane roads through the city.  I told the scout GPS to rout me home.  The highway is a little longer with a 45mph speed limit.  The through-town is 35mph and shorter.  With the old Toyota system, if I chose to NOT go the way the GPS directed, it would quickly recalculate and map the short route.  NOT the Scout GPS!  That stupidly designed, illogical subroutine tried to route me back to the State Route at *every* left turn I could have possibly made!  It would not stop until I was within a mile of my home!  The route it was recommending was NOT shorter NOR quicker, but it would not give up.  Every second you are in the car, it wants to use your data plan.  Furthermore, it does not want to navigate unless you PLUG IN THE PHONE WITH A WIRE!  What kind of convoluted, half-brained, inconvenience is that?   To enter in your destination takes darned near ten minutes!   To add insult to injury, you are completely out of luck if you are in a rural area, where the mountains cut off cell service regularly!.  You completely lose all navigation.  Unlike Google maps, where you can download a local map to your phone, you simply are lost without help with the Scout GPS. I **ordered** this car specially - I BEGGED the dealer to get me the upgraded built in navigation system, but Toyota DOES NOT OFFER IT ON THE top-of-the-line Camry.  How could you do this to your loyal customer base, Toyota?  Prior to this, I would not even shop for a different make, but all bets are off.  You blew it.Oh, yeah - after three years, you LOSE your subscription and have to pay for Scout!   I would not give two red cents for this mangled excuse for a navigation system.This system is the most illogical, DANGEROUS, instantiation of ""Infotainment"" I've ever run into - and since I traveled for work and rented a lot of cars, I have a lot to compare it to!First, I had a 2006 Camry Hybrid, then the Avalon 2016.  I compare to those.   If I had a text message come in, I would simply tap in the vicinity of the notification in the center of the screen.  I didn't have to take my eyes off the road.  Tap, and the message is read to me.  No problem.    With the Entune 3.0, the bell tolls, and the message receipt flashes so fast you almost cannot see it.  Then you have to press ""Phone"", then ""messages"", then the message in the list.  Yes, you have to take your eyes off the road and traffic to do so!   The hare-brained good-idea fairy engineer and the approving bosses that came up with the Entune 3.0 should be FIRED!In spite of the home screen, you really cannot easily change the mode or channels from the steering wheel as you could in the older models.  For example, in XM, the menu keeps defaulting to the XM ""replay"" instead of the presets.  Yes, you take your eyes off the road to go to press Audio, select the XM presets, and then the channel you have preset.   Why in God's Name would ANYONE want to drive and try to control their car with a smart phone or a convoluted reverse-logic UNSAFE system like the Entune 3.0?  Just how long should one be comfortable taking their eyes off the road to run down the rabbit hole of menus?  Furthermore, the Entune wants you to download countless apps that are quite happy on your phone, thank you so very much!  Yelp?  Seriously, I do not want people on the road using Yelp for *anything*.  ""Hang up and Drive!""Furthermore, all of these attention-grabbing (you know, taking your attention from the road) 'features' cost you in your data plan.  If you are in a big city, you might have it a little easier, but those of us that go Toyota because of its [former] safety and reliability because we drive long distances in desert, rural areas, will not enjoy that luxury.    However, the Camry is a lot sportier, and handles wonderfully.   The radar cruise control is messed up, compared to the 2016 Avalon, because a curve in the road makes the Camry respond with hard braking if there is an adjacent car.  Also, if a car ahead pulls into a right turn lane, the Camry brakes hard as if you were going to run into them.  I don't use the radar cruise control for this reason.

Highway driving increases mpg to 21-24+mpg,  depending on speed and brand of gas and no load on roof or trailerStability is also excellent.  Braking can be quite abrupt, system is designed to gauge speed and pressure of brake application.  Accidentally apply them too fast and hard will produce the most braking I've ever experienced.  A major disappointment is the rear brakes.  The rear outer pad wears unusually fast. I had to replace the rear brakes at 24000 miles, outer pads were worn, inner almost like new.   I suspect the metal backing of the brake pad is too tight in the mount.  My daughter's 4Runner had the exact problem.  I trimmed the steel tabs of the pads and only time will tell if it cured the problem.  The dealer denies ever having heard of a problem.","[('tool box', 'box'), ('lug wrench', 'wrench'), ('steel wheel', 'wheel'), ('city stop', 'stop'), ('brake application', 'application'), ('steel tabs', 'tabs')]","['rear pad', 'Basic model', 'small tool box', 'only time', 'wears fast', 'ever heard', 'outer pad', 'exact problem', 'typical city']","[['miles'], ['sport'], ['nt'], ['one', 'take'], ['second'], ['new'], ['nt'], ['miles'], ['nt', 'road'], ['nt', 'miles'], ['nt', 'miles'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['like', 'miles', 'new'], ['nt']]","[('roof rack', 'rack'), ('storage areas', 'areas'), ('alloy wheel', 'wheel'), ('Gas mileage', 'mileage'), ('1k miles', 'miles'), ('Highway driving', 'driving'), ('metal backing', 'backing'), ('brake pad', 'pad')]","['rear brakes', 'same 17mpg', 'ever experienced', 'normal rotation', 'deep box', 'excellent reliability', 'apply fast', 'large box', 'Accidentally apply', 'new tire', 'local city', 'second shelf', 'mountainous roads', 'small storage areas', 'Interior storage areas', 'outer brake pads', 'major disappointment']",neg
 on 08/16/17 11:45 AM (PDT),The Annoyed Man ,2015 Toyota 4Runner SUV Trail 4dr SUV 4WD (4.0L 6cyl 5A),"2015 Trail, Purchased new in March 2015"," ABOUT 4WD: I spend 99.99% of my time on paved roads, so I seldom have need to access this vehicle's 4WD features. That said, I have used it for off-road/dirt-road driving while hunting, and for driving on snow/ice. I haven't really had to fiddle with any of the various traction controlling features while in 4WD. The Edmunds review above is dead wrong in one respect: it says that both the Trail and Trail Premium models have full-time 4WD. That just not true. My trail spends most of its time in normal 2WD at the rear wheels. It has a 4WD shifter with high and low ranges, located next to the automatic transmission shift lever. It has to be manually switched into 4WD mode by use of the 4WD shifter. You can shift on the fly into the 4WD High range so long as your rolling at a reduced speed. Switching into the Low range requires coming to a full stop before pushing the lever into position. The differential and hubs lock automatically. ABOUT FUEL ECONOMY: Actual mileage for me has varied from as high as 24 mpg (rarely) while on extended road trips on the interstate, to 10 mpg while pulling a travel trailer with a GVRW of 3,850 lbs. I average between 15 and 17 mpg of mostly suburban street driving around town. ABOUT TOWING CAPACITY: The 4Runner may have a towing rating of 4,700 lbs, but I can tell you that towing 3,850 lbs at high speeds makes the engine feel a bit anemic, the transmission spends a lot of time shifting around, and highway speeds are seldom ever spent above 4th gear, let alone overdrive. This was on a trip from the DFW area to Los Angeles and back, so it covered everything from hills and mountains to long straight desert stretches. ABOUT HANDLING: My previous vehicle was a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder SE 4WD. The 4Runner Trail is a slightly bigger vehicle, and it drives like one. It's a little more ponderous in slower corners, and not quite as confidence inspiring in faster corners. In highway driving, I am not aware of the ""business"" that Edmunds noted in their review. At straight line highway speeds, the 4Runner seems stable and planted. If you mash the gas pedal, the 4Runner is capable of brisk acceleration, which will reward you with poor mileage if practiced too often. I use and monitor the in-dash fuel economy features to help me improve my mileage figures. A HANDLING CAUTION: Braking is good for an SUV of this size and weight, but I'll throw in a cautionary note..... several times I have been surprised by the anti-lock system engaging while braking, for no apparent reason, over clean pavement, without intending to execute a panic stop. I am not a habitual ""late-braker"", but this bug has led me to modify my driving accordingly by getting out of the gas sooner than I otherwise would, letting the vehicle coast down, and applying my brakes sooner and more gently than I am used to having to do. This is the only vehicle I've ever had that problem with. My wife currently drives a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk Edition, also purchased new in 2015, and her vehicle does not exhibit this trait, despite having many of the same features as my 4Runner. When my anti-lock system has kicked in like that, the 4Runner has hauled itself down PDQ, while tracking straight, but it worries me that if someone is tailgating me when this happens, that I might get rear-ended. ABOUT COMFORT AND INTERIOR: The front seats are comfortable and have enough adjustment range to fit all sizes. The driver's seat has adjustable lower lumbar support. The dash layout is easy to understand and is traditionally laid out. Everything is a little more spartan than in my wife's Cherokee - more ""truck-like"" compared to the Cherokee's ""car-like"". I test drove the Grand Cherokee before buying the 4Runner and Edmunds is correct that the Grand Cherokee, for all of its creature comforts, has nowhere near the interior room of the 4Runner. I prefer the Jeep's ""UConnect"" compared to which the Toyota's ""Entune"" interface seems a bit clunky. The Jeep's screen is larger and has better color management than the Toyota's. That said, Entune is a fully functioning suite of apps, and they all seem to work as advertised. My one complaint is that the navigation app's latency between screens is too long, so that entering an address into the app can take longer than it should. But once the information is entered, the app works just fine. OTHER: Almost 2-1/2 years later, the AC still blows nice and cold (a BIG deal here in Texas). The paint is holding up just fine. The tires are still in good shape (but in all fairness, I am retired now and I don't drive nearly as much as I used to). Nothing has broken. Maintenance has been at regular intervals, and thanks to warrantee, I haven't had to pay for an oil change yet. The SUV still looks sharp, and I get a lot of compliments from others about it. Overall, this 4Runner is a keeper, and as little as I drive now and at my current age (65), it is likely the last vehicle I'll ever buy. I love it.",5.0,"2015 Trail, Purchased new in March 2015 ABOUT 4WD: I spend 99.99% of my time on paved roads, so I seldom have need to access this vehicle's 4WD features.

 on 11/21/15 11:23 AM (PST),Al ,2015 Toyota 4Runner SUV Trail Premium 4dr SUV 4WD (4.0L 6cyl 5A),"Rugged, No... Quality, No... Technology, Horrible!"," Having been a loyal 4-Runner owner for over 20 years I was excited to supposedly upgrade to a newer version. I loved taking my stock 1995 4-Runner into the Colorado mountains off-roading, skiing, hiking and camping. Two years ago I purchased a Trail Premium version and this car is not what it claims to be, quality rugged or reliable. The dealership and the Toyota Customer Care Center know me by my first name due to the number of times the car has been in for the same issues, over 11 trips and counting. I know many readers will say this review isn't helpful but after reading about the issues search other reviews and you will find similarities, even the positive ones. I'm currently in the process of going to arbitration with Toyota because they can't and most importantly don't want to fix the technology issues with the 4-Runner. Toyota has been somewhat friendly and have tried to resolve most of the issues but you can't fix a cheap and poorly designed product. Almost everything that's going on is not unique to this one car they are for the most part related to the fleet.  The 2015 Trail Premium is grossly underpowered for its size which is a safety hazard when you need to accelerate. Never place the car in Drive, always manually shift through the 5 gears. This will make up for some of the marginal power performance and greatly improve the gas mileage which can stay at 14-15 miles per gallon when it's cold despite the manufacturer's claim of 17 to 21. Manually shifting I can stay in the 18-22 miles per gallon range and on one trip I even managed to get 34 mpg for over 75 miles.Systems such as the voice recognition, navigation and radio don't perform as claimed. It's not uncommon for these systems to freeze up requiring the car be pulled over and turned off in order to reset the entire system. I've had three radioheads replaced by Toyota in the last year, none of them including the latest remotely work right. The factory is currently working with the car to determine what the issues are. One Toyota rep was able to duplicate some of the same problems on his Tacoma. My 10-year old hand held Garmin is more accurate than the navigation system. The voice recognition system works accurately approximately 30% of the time even after taking multiple tutorials, reading the manual and taking it in to the dealership multiple times. Voice commands, directly from the ownerâs manual, only work 50% of the time. Referring to the Entune infotainment system Consumer Reports stated ""Toyota needs to go back to the drawing board"", I agree. I love backcountry mountain roads and moderate off-roading. I no longer take this 4-Runner off-road as it's not designed for anything more than a dry level dirt road. The off-road dials and traction systems that come on the Trail version are a complete joke and total waste of money as they rely on marginal technology vs driving skill. If you want something remotely off-road worthy, plan on spending another $3,000 to $10,000 to improve the awful ground clearance, street tires and sheet metal skid plates which fall apart when driving in deeper snow. The car is easily high centered in 10 to 12 inches of snow and horrible under adverse winter driving conditions as it slides sideways easily and without warning.The car has a known issue of accelerating backwards after a cold start if your foot isn't firmly on the peddle, with force, when placing it in reverse. I was told by the dealership ""if you think yours is bad try driving a Tundra"". Not the answer you would expect given Toyota recently had problems with uncontrolled acceleration.Squeaks and noises this car has them. The moon roof started rattling within two weeks of buying the car. In order to fix the problem the dealership had to replace the entire driver's side mechanism and it still squeaks. The dash developed a consistent squeak on the driverâs side. It was caused by the wheel well liner and my car resulted in the fix for the entire fleet. Again, common issues.The headlights are a real safety hazard as they project a perfectly straight horizontal line in front of the car, below the line is lighted and above the line isn't lite at all. Driving on a less than level road the line is constantly moving up and down which obscures obstacles in front of the car, especially animals. Friends riding in the car have commented on the poor lighting performance.The paint is paper thin, brittle and is easily scratched. I've never seen anything like it. Other 2015 and 2016 4-Runner owners I've talked to have shared similar experiences.While the car may be within ""performance standards"" it's an over-priced under performing version of the older 4-Runners. My girlfriend nicknamed the car the ""Fragile Butterfly"" due to the paint and its lack of off-road capability. The car is best known by my friends as ""Captain Crap"".

About 6,000 miles in, it developed a ""hum"" and vibration that you hear and feel in the pedal and steering wheel when you have your foot on the accelerator that stops when you let off but they told me that all of the 4Runners do the same thing.The ""tilt"" steering wheel is manual, clunky and very, well, why bother! The engine is WAY under powered!  It struggles at on-ramps!  Why Toyota does not offer an 8 cyl I do not know! The ""leather"" on the seats is of VERY poor quality and absorbs any color from like jeans, belts, etc.The technology is ok but the voice activation leaves a lot to be desired!  More frustrating than helpful!The exterior paint is about the thinnest on the market!  Had I know about the paint, I never would have purchased the crappy thing.  I got a paint chip in the real tailgate (how I don't know) but it barely has any paint covering the primer!  I wish I had done my research before purchasing it. Don't try to ride with the front windows open as the design forces all the wind in your face.  Open the sunroof and you get an awful rumble!60,000 MILE UPDATE (YES, IN A YEAR AND A HALF SO KNOW I DRIVE A LOT!)The vehicle has gotten worse with miles.Here are the major issues:Front Seats - Color is coming off the leather which actually started within 6 months after purchase.ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AND BLUETOOTH HAS MAJOR ISSUES! -  It looses bluetooth connectivity for days at a time so nothing will sync up to where the bluetooth icon is even greyed out and it seems Toyota doesn't care for some reason.  After this happened, I researched online and found that this same thing has been happening in several models since like 2014!At times ALL the controls on the system and the steering wheel freeze up.

About 6,000 miles in, it developed a ""hum"" and vibration that you hear and feel in the pedal and steering wheel when you have your foot on the accelerator that stops when you let off but they told me that all of the 4Runners do the same thing.The ""tilt"" steering wheel is manual, clunky and very, well, why bother! The engine is WAY under powered!  It struggles at on-ramps!  Why Toyota does not offer an 8 cyl I do not know! The ""leather"" on the seats is of VERY poor quality and absorbs any color from like jeans, belts, etc.The technology is ok but the voice activation leaves a lot to be desired!  More frustrating than helpful!The exterior paint is about the thinnest on the market!  Had I know about the paint, I never would have purchased the crappy thing.  I got a paint chip in the real tailgate (how I don't know) but it barely has any paint covering the primer!  I wish I had done my research before purchasing it. Don't try to ride with the front windows open as the design forces all the wind in your face.  Open the sunroof and you get an awful rumble!60,000 MILE UPDATE (YES, IN A YEAR AND A HALF SO KNOW I DRIVE A LOT!)The vehicle has gotten worse with miles.Here are the major issues:Front Seats - Color is coming off the leather which actually started within 6 months after purchase.ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AND BLUETOOTH HAS MAJOR ISSUES! -  It looses bluetooth connectivity for days at a time so nothing will sync up to where the bluetooth icon is even greyed out and it seems Toyota doesn't care for some reason.  After this happened, I researched online and found that this same thing has been happening in several models since like 2014!At times ALL the controls on the system and the steering wheel freeze up.

I looked at all the usual suspects, including the Explorer, Tuareg and Grand Cherokee.  In the end, I chose the 4-Runner because of its off-road capability.  I also find that it handles very well, and is very smooth, on the freeway.  Don't listen to many reviews of this vehicle, as it's great.  I opted for the Limited for the interior upgrades.  I love the stereo system - great sounding radio and CD.  The one compromise, in my opinion, was the 20-inch wheels.  They are more highway-ready than off-road capable, given that they are more narrow than their 17-inch counterparts on the SR5 and Trail.  So far, it's performed great, even off-road. Second review.  Now with over 10,000 miles on the vehicle and considering it's now 'broken in', I had hoped to realize more MPG.  I still get 18.9 to 19.00 for all-around driving.  Even interstate driving doesn't positively affect the MPG.  So be it.  I knew this when I purchased it.  It handles well, and the engine is powerful and I like the growl.Third review.  After owning this vehicle for two years now, it's proved to be a great investment.  Only had one repair/maintenance issue, which was the window motor on the passenger-rear window malfunctioned.  Toyota fixed it gratis - probably covered under warranty.  I'd complained about gas mileage previously, and it's getting better MPG now that it's fully broken in.  Done some non-challenging off-road excursions with the 4Runner, and it's been up to the task.  On the highway, the ride continues to be solid and smooth.  And, as mentioned before, I love the sound system.  For people who do not like the Entune system, I find it intuitive and easy to operate.  I look forward to many years of future reliable service from this vehicle.Fourth review.  With over 22,000 miles now, the 4Runner operates smoothly and efficiently.  Haven't hit 20mpg yet, though.  Still the number one complaint - the gas mileage.  Glad that gasoline is still cheap.  I've experienced no problems, and Toyota maintenance is great, with oil changes, tire rotations, etc.  Still glad I bought it.Fifth review.

 on 12/26/17 13:47 PM (PST),Warren ,2018 Toyota 4Runner SUV TRD OFF-ROAD 4dr SUV 4WD (4.0L 6cyl 5A),Disappointed in Sluggish Gas Guzzling performance," I'm a first time Toyota owner.  Have always loved the 4runner look and finally decided to trade my F-150 and try one.  I went with the TRD off road model because I really like the sportier all black trim on the inside and the rims.  I probably won't do a lot of off-roading but I do have use for the 4 wheel drive in the winter and I love the ""truck"" feel.  Not many SUVs left like it.  Also, I'm not a tech guy so the lack of tech options that many reviews talk about doesn't bother me.  So, I've had my new 4runner for a few weeks now and have my first 1,000 miles on it.  About half of those are highway miles.  There is a lot that I really like about it.  Love the way it looks, love the stance, interior is comfortable but not too plush, ride is quite nice for an off-roader, quality seems great, no squeaks or rattles which I can't stand.  I have to sadly say though, that I'm very disappointed with the engine performance.  It feels extremely sluggish and non-responsive to the gas pedal.  I noticed this even on test drive but figured It was just different from what I was used to and since all the reviews I read pegged the 0-60 at 7.5-8 seconds, I didn't think it would be an issue and I'd quickly get used to it.  Unfortunately, not the case.  The sluggishness is a continual disappointment.  In fact, I have tested the 0-60 myself about a half dozen times and I can't get to 60 in under 10 seconds.  That's nailed to the floor 100%.  If I actually drove like that, I think I would get about 5 mpg!  Normal accelerator use takes FOREVER to get to normal highway speed.  That leads me to my second real disappointment which is the fuel consumption.  I knew from reviews that these were not great with gas mileage but mine in considerably worse even then the estimate ratings.  They are rated 17 city - 21 hwy (avg 18).  As I noted above, I drive about a 50/50 mix and my avg mpg after 1,000 miles has topped out at only 15.7 mpg!  Even being very ""gentle"" with the accelerator, I can't get it to creep up any higher than that.  I should say that I'm not trying to nit-pic.  I REALLY wanted to love this vehicle.  I'm just really struggling to get past the poor performance issues.  I wonder, are the 0-60 ratings and mpg ratings just overly generous/overstated, or could there possibly actually be some kind of a problem with my engine?  And I wonder if any other owners share these disappointments?  Anyway, if these issues are of concern to you, you're definitely not going to be pleasantly surprised by the 4runner.",3.0,"Disappointed in Sluggish Gas Guzzling performance I'm a first time Toyota owner.

Even after I purchase something I then end up researching even more to confirm that my decision was a good one.   My lease was coming to an end of what I called my ""rental car"".  That lease was a 2016 Malibu.  No complaints about that car...I needed a cheap lease for two years and it did the job.   I have had my eyes on trucks throughout the whole lease.   So I have been researching mid-size and full size trucks along with some SUV's.    If it is on the market, I test drove it.   I fell in love with the stance and ride height of the Dodge Ram, of all things.   However, I have absolutely no need for a pickup truck of that size.  I have a family of 5 and we bring a bunch of stuff with us.  I want it weather protected.  The crossover three rows are practical but none of them gave me the feeling that Ram gave me.   Out of curiosity, I went to look at Tundras.  I knew they were out of my price range and again, I didn't need a truck.  That is when I stumbled upon the 4Runners.  I have always liked these SUV's but never drove one.   Grabbed a salesman and off we went.   Then all the stars aligned!  This was it!   That feeling of the stance of a Dodge Ram, way more spacious than a Tacoma or Canyon, the reliability of a Toyota, room for family, a closed rear that can haul everything protected, and that super hard to resist rear window!!!!   Me being me, I had to sleep on this and do more research.   So the endless Youtubing began.   There is no competition for this vehicle unless you go super high end off road or Wrangler.   After a bad Mopar experience I will never go Wrangler....plus to get one with 4 doors and a hard top you are getting up there in price.  When you youtube 4runners all you see for the most part is 4x4 off roading with lots of mods.   This is cool and all but not something that was selling me.   I live in Florida.  I am not going up any hills, it does not snow and, even if I had a 4x4, I certainly wouldn't push a brand new 40k vehicle to its limits.   Fact is 2x4 or 4x4  drive the same on the road, have the same stance and height and the 2x4 version gets 1mpg better gas.  Not to mention the less stuff to break argument.   So.....  I purchased myself a 2018 SR5 Premium  (fake leather, navigation and sunroof for premium).   The truck had 18 miles on it and it was the perfect color combo that I wanted.   The premium/non-premium was a last minute decision.  The cloth feels great compared to the ""softex"" fake leather.   However, I have kids.  Kids spill stuff.  So, I got the softex.                      On with the review.....   I. love. this. truck!    We took a road trip to Miami a day after I bought it.  The wife and all three kids were super comfortable and loved riding up higher than usual.   I dont know what it is but there is just something nice about the way this rides compared to a crossover.  It feels like a tank...but like a really comfortable tank!    One thing that I thought would bother me ended up not at all.... that is the dated technology.    I had Carplay on my Malibu and was dissapointed this didn' come with.    Let me tell you that I much prefer not having it.   Here is the thing about carplay.... You have to be hardwired in and it completely takes over everything.   All of the sudden the Apple Music station comes on every time you end a call or end a trip.   It gets confused managing bluetooth and usb at the same time.   The technology on carplay isnt worked out yet.   Thats the beauty of the 4runners tech..... it is simple and has been boiled down to stuff that works.   Bluetooth when you want it and only when you want it!   A CD Player!!!!!!  HD Radio!   Knobs!  BIG enormous knobs!  The touch screen is small and old school but it processes instantly.  No waiting for the latest and greatest of apps to load.  I even like the lack of auto climate control...especially dual zone...   I could never get any of my vehicles to dial in just right automatically.    The big bonus of all this is that the lack of tech means there is so much that WILL NOT BREAK!    And for Florida winters....open up all the windows including the sunroof and rear window and you basically have a open air vehicle.    Such and amazing driving experience on the highway.   Around town I love this thing even more.   You tower over cars without have a super wide or long vehicle.   You can see everything.   The extent of my off roading will be dirt roads, grass or gravel.   I took it down one dirt road and it felt great.   I play on keeping this truck for a long time and hopefully the honeymoon never ends with this vehicle.   It just feels amazing to drive and solidly built.   Don't let the old technology prevent you from owning one of these.  Half that stuff you will not use past the show room.   And it will be buggy and it will break.    2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive, depending on your needs, this truck is magic.",5.0,"Dont think about it....just buy it I am the type of consumer that over researches everything and then agonizes for weeks over what to do.

Thats the beauty of the 4runners tech..... it is simple and has been boiled down to stuff that works.   Bluetooth when you want it and only when you want it!   A CD Player!!!!!!  HD Radio!   Knobs!  BIG enormous knobs!  The touch screen is small and old school but it processes instantly.  No waiting for the latest and greatest of apps to load.  I even like the lack of auto climate control...especially dual zone...   I could never get any of my vehicles to dial in just right automatically.    The big bonus of all this is that the lack of tech means there is so much that WILL NOT BREAK!    And for Florida winters....open up all the windows including the sunroof and rear window and you basically have a open air vehicle.    Such and amazing driving experience on the highway.   Around town I love this thing even more.   You tower over cars without have a super wide or long vehicle.   You can see everything.   The extent of my off roading will be dirt roads, grass or gravel.   I took it down one dirt road and it felt great.   I play on keeping this truck for a long time and hopefully the honeymoon never ends with this vehicle.   It just feels amazing to drive and solidly built.   Don't let the old technology prevent you from owning one of these.  Half that stuff you will not use past the show room.   And it will be buggy and it will break.    2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive, depending on your needs, this truck is magic.","[('Mopar experience', 'experience'), ('Kids stuff', 'stuff'), ('spill stuff', 'stuff'), ('driving experience', 'experience'), ('s room', 'room')]","['bad Mopar driving experience', 'dated technology', 'So got', 'Then aligned', 'So began', 'closed rear', 'fake leather', 'then agonizes', 'Such Mopar driving experience', 'same time', 'rear window', 'However have', 'never go', 'more research']","[['nt', 'think'], ['good', 'one'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt', 'car'], ['year'], ['truck'], ['truck'], ['test'], ['love'], ['truck'], ['nt'], ['one'], ['nt'], ['range', 'new', 'truck'], ['like', 'one'], ['nt'], ['vehicle', 'road'], ['one'], ['road'], ['vehicle', 'new'], ['drive', 'road'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'miles', 'truck'], ['minute'], ['great'], ['love'], ['bought', 'road', 'truck'], ['love', 'wife'], ['nt'], ['like', 'tank'], ['like', 'tank'], ['nt', 'come'], ['car'], ['take'], ['come'], ['nt', 'car', 'work'], ['work'], ['nt'], ['test', 'great'], ['nt', 'like'], ['one'], ['vehicle'], ['nt'], ['vehicle'], ['love'], ['vehicle', 'car'], ['nt', 'road'], ['one', 'road', 'great'], ['vehicle', 'one', 'truck'], ['drive'], ['nt', 'one'], ['drive', 'truck']]","[('size trucks', 'trucks'), ('ride height', 'height'), ('pickup truck', 'truck'), ('price range', 'range'), ('40k vehicle', 'vehicle'), ('color combo', 'combo'), ('minute decision', 'decision'), ('road trip', 'trip'), ('Music station', 'station'), ('touch screen', 'screen'), ('auto climate', 'climate'), ('climate control', 'control'), ('tech means', 'means'), ('Florida winters', 'winters'), ('air vehicle', 'vehicle'), ('dirt roads', 'roads'), ('dirt road', 'road'), ('wheel drive', 'drive'), ('wheel drive', 'drive')]","['small school', 'especially dual zone', 'better gas', 'then end', 'whole lease', 'basically have', 'took down', 'never drove', 'super high end', 'last minute', 'high end', 'ended all', 'rental car', 'less stuff', 'even had', 'worked yet', 'most part', 'never ends', 'old technology', 'mid size', 'hopefully ends', 'completely takes', 'really comfortable tank', 'super wide 40k air vehicle', 'dual zone', 'rear window', 'open 40k air vehicle', 'long time', 'comfortable tank', 'always liked', 'again need', 'solidly built', 'hard top', 'dial automatically', 'processes instantly', 'perfect color combo', 'fake leather', 'Even purchase', 'full size', 'enormous knobs', 'However have', 'new 40k', 'big bonus', 'BIG knobs', 'certainly push', '1mpg gas', 'cheap lease', 'So researching', 'same stance', 'wide 40k air vehicle', 'love more']",neg

 on 01/18/18 17:17 PM (PST),Duane Mason ,2000 Toyota 4Runner SUV 4dr SUV,Bulletproof Daily Driver," I have the 4-cylinder, Manual Transmission model. For those unacquainted, that is the legendary 2.7 Liter, 3RZ-FE, with the superb, W59 manual transmission. Mine is bone stock, and set up for Street. It has a weekly commute of 20 miles both ways, on mostly freeway. I have heard some complaints about the 2.7 lacking power. Well those people must be driving the Automatic version. (The Auto cannot put as much power down as the Manual. Especially on hills, or passing situations, where you can easily downshift with a clutch). This engine is strong in the low and mid-range rpm's, it has much more torque than horsepower.  Anyway I bought this car 6 years ago, and it had 130,000 miles. That did not worry me at all. Because it is a Toyota. Moreover, it was built during a time, when Toyota was more hard-nosed. Back when they were more hungry, and had more swagger. There was no rust, the carfax looked reasonable, and my mechanic inspected it for about 30 minutes. He said it looked good, then I bought it later that day. Right now it has 232,000 miles on the odometer, and the car doesn't seem phased at all, by the high mileage. My goal is at least 350,000 with this car. I've seen a youtube videos of people with 400,000 original miles on their 3rd gens, so I know it is capable. My initial reaction upon seeing, and driving the 3rd gen 4runner, was the impressive Build Quality. The car has an aura of excellent construction, in every category. The engine is strong, torquey, and loves to be in the low and mid-range rpm's. (It gets pretty weak around 4.5k+ rpm's, so it is rather useless to push it too high, in the powerband). The transmission is high-quality. It goes through the gears with a fluid, confident feel. While driving, there are no creaks in the body panels, or annoying sounds that emanate from the interior. The 4runner is spectacular on the freeway. Even at 90mph, the car is solid and assured. It eats up miles at high speeds, like a GT car. Yet be careful not to throw off the balance too much at high speeds, because it is an SUV, not a sports car. For example, a sudden, jerky, right-left maneuver at 90+mph. (I highly recommend Kumho Solus KR21 and Kumho Solus TA11 with this car, they are a great match for the stock form, and not too expensive). In stock form, It is still a fun driver's car, and quite nimble for what it is. Rear-Wheel Drive, my favorite. Yet recognize that it is not a sports car. (I have owned a few sports cars in my day, and still think this is a fun car).  Onto the interior: My lowly ""Base"" model, has very comfortable, cloth seats. They are plush and provide just enough adjustment. The steering wheel is good leather with a heavy-ish feel, excellent build quality. The instrument panel is pleasing and logical. Overall the interior is great, I love it. I have taken 6-hour plus road trips, in this car and it is comfortable the whole time. Another thing is, the back seats can fold forward, and then you have a 6-foot truck bed, inside your 4runner. Awesome. This car is the perfect size imho, for a mid-size, all-around, very reliable daily driver. The MPG is pretty good for what it is. I'm no Bean Counter, and drive hard, yet gas money hasn't hurt me. The major repairs, and their approximate costs I have had to deal with during my time of ownership:   Power Steering Rack replacement ($1,000), Clutch ($500), Differential U-joints ($500), Brakes and Rotors ($350). Other than that, I do synethic oil changes every 6-7k, changed the tires once, and did a tune up about 10k miles ago. It is a low maintenance car and I am shooting for the long haul, 350,000+ original miles. One final thing I must stress about the 4runner:  Every morning when I wake up for work, and get ready to start it, there is no doubt in my mind, that it will start, and run well. That is a priceless feeling. Many people fear their cars. In the hard struggles of life, I know that this car has my back, and will not let me down. As long as I give it minimal love and maintenance. It has NEVER left me stranded, and when it had an issue, you could tell that a problem was developing, over a period of at least 3 weeks, (like the Differential U-Joints). It never simply ""gave out"", like many other, inferior cars. The car is a soldier. It has gained my trust and admiration. I can see why so many people respect these cars, across the world. And why they are preferred, so often, in brutal, war-like environments in the Middle East and Africa. The 3rd gen 4runner is dependable, trustworthy, fun to drive, comfortable, plus it looks good.

One final thing I must stress about the 4runner:  Every morning when I wake up for work, and get ready to start it, there is no doubt in my mind, that it will start, and run well. That is a priceless feeling. Many people fear their cars. In the hard struggles of life, I know that this car has my back, and will not let me down. As long as I give it minimal love and maintenance. It has NEVER left me stranded, and when it had an issue, you could tell that a problem was developing, over a period of at least 3 weeks, (like the Differential U-Joints). It never simply ""gave out"", like many other, inferior cars. The car is a soldier. It has gained my trust and admiration. I can see why so many people respect these cars, across the world. And why they are preferred, so often, in brutal, war-like environments in the Middle East and Africa. The 3rd gen 4runner is dependable, trustworthy, fun to drive, comfortable, plus it looks good. Could not ask for a better daily driver.","[('Transmission model', 'model')]","['right left maneuver', 'worry all', 'initial reaction', 'priceless feeling', 'easily downshift', 'as much power', 'manual transmission', 'useless to push', 'Moreover built', 'high quality', 'left maneuver', 'much power']","[['nt'], ['one'], ['miles'], ['nt'], ['people'], ['range'], ['miles', 'bought', 'year', 'car'], ['minute', 'car'], ['good', 'bought'], ['miles', 'car'], ['car'], ['miles', 'people'], ['nt', 'car'], ['range', 'love'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['car'], ['like', 'miles', 'car'], ['car', 'sport'], ['car', 'great'], ['drive', 'car'], ['car', 'sport'], ['car', 'think', 'sport'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'good'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'love', 'great'], ['car', 'take', 'road'], ['truck'], ['drive', 'car', 'imho'], ['good'], ['drive', 'nt', 'one'], ['nt'], ['miles'], ['nt', 'miles', 'car'], ['work'], ['car', 'people'], ['car'], ['nt', 'give', 'love'], ['nt', 'like'], ['like', 'car'], ['car'], ['car', 'people'], ['nt', 'like'], ['drive', 'good'], ['drive']]","[('bone stock', 'stock'), ('range rpm', 'rpm'), ('youtu videos', 'videos'), ('body panels', 'panels'), ('GT car', 'car'), ('sports car', 'car'), ('stock form', 'form'), ('stock form', 'form'), ('fun driver', 'driver'), ('sports car', 'car'), ('sports cars', 'cars'), ('cloth seats', 'seats'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('build quality', 'quality'), ('road trips', 'trips'), ('foot truck', 'truck'), ('truck bed', 'bed'), ('size imho', 'imho'), ('gas money', 'money'), ('Rack replacement', 'replacement'), ('U joints', 'joints'), ('oil changes', 'changes'), ('maintenance car', 'car')]","['throw much', 'fun to drive', 'major repairs', 'changed once', 'reliable fun driver', 'back cloth seats', 'final thing', 'then bought', 'perfect size', 'highly recommend', 'GT sports sports maintenance careful to throw', 'ready to start', 'fold forward', 'better fun driver', 'low range rpm', 'synethic oil changes', 'mid size', 'weekly commute', 'comfortable cloth seats', 'phased all', 'very comfortable cloth seats', 'did up', 'very reliable fun driver', 'still think', 'NEVER left', 'much more torque', 'low GT sports sports maintenance car', 'daily fun driver', 'drive hard', 'few GT sports sports sports maintenance cars', 'original miles', 'Many people', 'annoying sounds', 'more torque', 'excellent build quality', 'high speeds', 'enough adjustment', 'instrument panel', 'then have', 'many GT sports sports sports maintenance cars', 'run well', 'other GT sports sports sports maintenance cars', '3rd gens', 'Automatic version', 'whole time', 'bought ago', 'long haul', 'approximate costs', 'good leather', 'bought later', 'hard struggles', 'did ago', 'excellent construction', 'lowly model', 'minimal love', 'inferior GT sports sports sports maintenance cars', 'many people', 'simply gave', 'great match', 'high mileage', 'heavy ish']",neg

I would have considered the Trail Premium, but really did not want to live with the coal mine interior (black/gray) that is the only option on that model. The Limited wasnât attractive to me because it has several things I did not want (permanent 4WD, lower-profile tires, power running boards, power tailgate, seats made with cow leather). The only option that I chose was the fixed running boards - I know that they might be a compromise off-road, but they make such a difference on entry/exit that there was no question about having them.Driving impressions: Over 10,000 miles I have driven a mix of suburban commute and highway, including a 4,500 mile trip from the East coast to Colorado, where we travelled for 100+ miles on unpaved Forest Service roads. No true off-roading, but the USFS roads were rocky, steep, switchbacked washboards in places. It was excellent, and fast enough for me, even at altitudes of 10,000+ feet. The steep descents and switchbacks on unpaved roads were the first place Iâve actually found a use for manual shifting in an automatic transmission. The truck cruises nicely at 80+mph Out West. Itâs no sports car, but feels solid and rides well.Iâve seen reviews that regret the lack of a V8 option, but the current 4L V6 has more power and torque than the previous V8 in a 4Runner, so Iâm not sure what the benefit would be. The transmission âonlyâ has five speeds, but that is of no importance to me - it works just fine. Fuel consumption is usually between 19 and 20mpg, and on the long trip was 20.4 from start to finish.Comfort: My wife does not like driving the 4Runner (she says itâs big, heavy and truck-like - all true) but finds riding in it comfortable. For comparison, her vehicle is an Acura RDX. Actually, the 4Runner is a lot easier to park than the RDX because you can see the corners and it doesnât have the fashionable angled windows. The back seat is spacious and comfortable. The main problem with comfort is for the dog, because itâs quite a jump up to the load area where she has her bed. (BTW: A Weather Tech tray in the load area is a great idea). The dog really likes the opening tailgate window! The only comfort issue I can think of is that it takes longer than I would like to get the heater working in cold weather - itâs nice to have the seat heaters on a cold morning.Interior: The interior is functional, but not bleak, and is a little dated. The cockpit looks like the boombox that you bought in 1985, but all of the controls are well placed and feel solid. Overall, I like it. The fake leather seats in this trim level are comfortable and seem durable. Only the driverâs seat has lumbar and height adjustments, and there is no memory function at this trim level.Electronics: The standard Entune system is just about good enough. I like the head unit, although itâs shorter on power than I would prefer, and the curves of its frequency equalization are weird. The only thing Iâve changed is that I replaced the speakers in the front and rear doors with much better ones. Big improvement for not much money. I love having my entire audio collection on a 128GB thumb drive, and use the XM radio often enough that itâs worth the subscription (despite XMâs nasty compression artefacts). Books on CD work well (as do music CDs). The maps in the navigation system even have the USFS roads - a bit of a surprise there. One irritation with the navigation is that you canât do much with it when youâre moving, even from the passenger seat. The BlueTooth phone connection works very well; the only problems are that itâs âforgottenâ about my phone a couple of times and it canât see texts or email on my phone (Google Nexus, Android 6). The Entune system has voice recognition that you train to your voice, but is totally worthless - it will cause either laughter or rage but it certainly wonât be of any use to you.The info-tronics play no part in controlling the vehicle, which I see as an advantage - no need to control seat heaters or ventilation through the touch screen.Problems: No real problems. The only issue is a persistent wheel balance shake at 62-63mph. The dealer has tried to fix it three times and has made it different each time.

 on 07/31/17 00:07 AM (PDT),Shawn ,2017 Toyota Yaris iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6M),First thoughts of owning a Yaris IA," This review is being written after my first two days of owning the Yaris IA. I've driven hills, highways, and city. Only thing left is curvy mountain roads and inclement weather. Prior to owning this car I drove my friends 2015 Honda Civic LX Manual. So that is my comparison for the Yaris IA. -------------------------------------------------------------WHAT I LIKE - PRICE: It's a great car for a first time owner. I honestly don't believe you can do better for the price for how much the car provides. INFOTAINMENT: I've heard mixed responses on the Mazda style shift knob to control the music, etc. But I honestly love it. After a single drive I think all cars should be heading in that direction. I also really like the Display. Bright, crisp, with good customization. I think back to my buddys honda and I practically have a tv over his mini screen. INTERIOR: For the subcompact class I think this is where the Yaris really shines. The interior looks sleek and attractive with a good mixture of textures. I appreciate the blue/black schema as well. Only complaint is some clear areas that held together loosely. The middle console you can shift quite a bit if you're trying to. This however I don't think will ever come up during us so I'm not worried. MIDDLE ARMREST: This was a concern before I got the car. If it'd be comfortable with nothing to put my right elbow on during driving. However, even after a long drive, I found it hadn't bothered me at all. In fact, it felt very natural to rest my hand on the control for the infotainment system the whole drive. Surprised how natural that felt. HANDLING: The car does feel very responsive. I've been enjoying myself to say the least. FUEL ECONOMY: I'm currently averaging 34mpg with some aggressive driving. My buddies Honda doing the same drives averages 28mpg. That speaks enough right there. BACK UP CAM: Once again comparing to my buddies honda the camera on this thing is much brighter and more detailed. However, at night it becomes extremely pixelated and blotchy. Totally usable, but a noticeable drop in quality of image. Frankly, having a back up cam at this price at all is amazing, so still a plus. --------------------------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE: ACCELERATION: Admittedly I'm still getting used to the manual in this car but I'm having trouble getting this puppy going. Once I get up to about 2 or 3 things go just fine but the low end torque is nothing to be impressed by. BACKSEATS: I'm a personal trainer, I weigh 220lbs with broad shoulders at 5'11"". I'm a little above average but I do feel pretty big in this car. The front seats accommodate well enough but if you have friends taller than 5'8"" they will not be comfortable in the back. I mean, it's a subcompact, what do you expect, but damn. I put 3 friends plus myself in there and it was a clown car. FRONTSEATS: The side wings on the front seat don't feel immediately comfortable to me. It may be different for differently shaped people but for me it's like they're poking my sides. This however, is mediated. When I drive for a long time it doesn't become unbearable. It may just be a getting used to it thing since I don't even notice the seats after an hour drive. STORAGE: Now, trunk storage is fantastic. Don't worry about that. I don't think you can do better in this class. However, cabin storage like a middle divider is completely absent. Two cubbys and two cup holders. I'm having to get creative with where i store things like Loose change and gum. PAINT: Now, this isn't so much a concern now but I did see a review once saying the paint was cheap and chips easily. I'll have to see across the years that I own this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL THOUGHTS: So, I just listed certain talking points that I know I want people to tell me about in their reviews. But, in the end, I'm loving this car. Having got it used for 14k with less than 2,000 miles on it I can't believe how much I'm getting for my money. I feel like I'm in a much more expensive car while in the interior and the driving experience is just fine as long as you're not drag racing. i honestly don't think you can do much better for the money. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I will update this review in 6 months after I finish my first Maintenance.",4.0,"First thoughts of owning a Yaris IA This review is being written after my first two days of owning the Yaris IA.

That's a plus for value, performance, pricing and design. The pros  are many and I'll list a few. The 6 speed manual transmission ranks with BMW for ease of shifting and overall responsiveness. However, after 8,500 miles, I've noticed a clutch problem in first gear. The car has started to shutter when engaging the clutch. I've also noted that the car's idling RPMs has dropped for 800 to 600 and the car's idle has become less smooth. The car handles as well or, probably, far better than any car in its class. Fuel economy is on the fringe of a hybrid. I get 32 to 35 in town and have gotten as much as 52 on the highway. You'll hear the car is sluggish on hills and while passing at high speeds. I can only believe comments like that are based on the automotive or not shifting at higher RPMs  (3,200 to 3,600). If you shift at lower RPMs the car does not receive adequate torque and may seem sluggish. It's not. The car's safety features are first in its class and the car has a five star crash rating. It comes with a myriad of standard features; many you'll pay more for in other cars in its class. The information system is easy to use and provides you a wide range of necessary information and entertainment features. I could add many more pros but choose to provide you with a few cons. This is a four seater. The center back seat is virtually useless. The car's digital tachometer, with its analogue design, is small and hard to read in direct sunlight. This is a minor issue because, with the manual transmission, it's a necessity. In the center of the tach you'll see two numbers; the gear you're in and the gear Toyota suggests you should be in. The suggested gear must be based upon fuel economy not performance. It has you shifting into 6th gear at 47 MPH...absurd. In summary this is not a sub compact. It's the same size as the Civic. Making it a compact. I've owned several cars including numerous BMWs, a Lexus and Jaguar. For $16,500 to $20,000, finding a better car will be virtually impossible.Have now owned this car for a year and a half.The car's performance continues to impress me. It isn't slow and if you have the manual and downshift when it makes sense, it's not slow on hills or on highways.I have two legitimate concerns that potential buyers must consider. The tire size on this car is 185 60r 16. There is only one tire made in this size in the US. It's a Toyo. The tire is average, at best, and finding a replacement other than from a higher priced Toyota dealer is a challenge. In fact, only one of some 15+ tire retailers carry this tire, Tire rack. They charge $101 for the tire plus shipping. Toyota dealerships charge more. This fact, coupled with the fact that the car comes with a small spare, is a flaw that cannot be resolved.I've now owned this car The Toyo tires that come on the car remains a significant error on the part of Toyota or Mazda. I've done 8,400 miles of driving and the tires, according to Toyota, Tire Rack and Toyo will not last 20,000 miles. This is the only tire in its size that available on the iA and Toyo has told me the replacement tire would result in the same tire life. I check my tire pressure twice a month and rotate the tires as recommended. This issue is not on me. Poor life expectancy coupled with sub par handling performance and just average wet and dry traction are an annoyance that can't be resolved. As of 8,400 miles my tread depth has dropped to six. You should consider replacing tires when their depth drops below 4. Meaning, I'll be replacing these tires before12,000...unexceptable. Another build quality issue to consider is the thin sheet metal. The car scratches easily and someone leaning against the car could cause a dent.Would I still buy this car again, of course.

 on 03/29/17 13:28 PM (PDT),Eric ,2015 Toyota Venza Wagon XLE 4dr Wagon (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Her name is Lemon Aid Updated," So an update. I owned this car 18 months and put 34,000 miles on it. I had to cut my losses and trade it due to constant repairs. general complaints, loud, man is this car loud, tire noise was no joke at highway speeds. CHEAP, the interior of this car is so cheap, the power window actually causes the door to bulge out when it reached its stops. I learned later that the dealer had painted all the leather to cover the wear damage, and it all started rubbing off revealing how poorly the material aged. Truthfully, the leather cost me $1000 in trade value because it was so bad after the paint and patching wore off. very disappointing since my last car was 20, and the leather was perfect. The drivers visor fell apart, It had to be removed.

I learned later that the dealer had painted all the leather to cover the wear damage, and it all started rubbing off revealing how poorly the material aged.

Overall this really is a good little car, gets the job done, decent pickup for the size, smooth enough ride although there is significant road noise compared to other vehicles I've driven, and good feel to it while driving.  HOWEVER, there seems to be an issue with the windshields that Toyota is getting from its vendor.  My original windshield had a very weird magnifying effect with random waves running through it that would distort the view of cars, the road, and other objects as you drove it.  I took it to the dealer who agreed with me and replaced it, only to find the second one had the same problem.  The third windshield is much better but still have two waves running through the driver's viewing range from different angles creating a significant distraction, and if you drive the car long enough, tension headaches.  It seems Toyota is sick of dealing with this issue and is, what appears to be, refusing to fix the third defective windshield.  I was given a loaner while my car has been in the shop for 1.5 months back and forth over this issue and the loaner appears to be fine.

 on 09/11/15 14:55 PM (PDT),mixer ,2015 Toyota Corolla Sedan LE Plus 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),"Good car with looks and features, noisy cabin"," Bought a 2015 Corolla LE Plus. Love the looks vs the Camry's or the Corolla S Plus. The S plus has a bigger grille and darker rims which I did not like vs the smaller grille and shinier rims on the LE Plus model.  I liked the steering on low speed with this car, but the thing I really disliked was hi-way driving. It is too sensitive in the steering at that speed, so it is kinda like a struggle to keep the car straight and it doesn't help that the car is more prone to wind blowing, so that makes the struggle even harder (especially near trucks).Acceleration is adequate. The ride is actually a little firm (good thing I didn't get the S Plus!) But the road noise can get harsh in freeway driving.

Love the looks vs the Camry's or the Corolla S Plus. The S plus has a bigger grille and darker rims which I did not like vs the smaller grille and shinier rims on the LE Plus model.  I liked the steering on low speed with this car, but the thing I really disliked was hi-way driving. It is too sensitive in the steering at that speed, so it is kinda like a struggle to keep the car straight and it doesn't help that the car is more prone to wind blowing, so that makes the struggle even harder (especially near trucks).Acceleration is adequate. The ride is actually a little firm (good thing I didn't get the S Plus!) But the road noise can get harsh in freeway driving.

I didn't realize it at the time of purchase, but the car had been rear-ended before I bought it and this is possibly why I've had to replace the rear brake shoes twice since I've owned it, or maybe it's just a fluke with my car. I also had to replace all four wheel bearings at 125K which was quite expensive, however not too surprising of a repair for a car with over 100k miles. The wire in the steering column to activate airbags has malfunctioned and will cost $500 to fix.

It is a great value. The safety features that come standard are awesome. I like the radar-responsive cruise control for highway commuting, as well as the lane alert. The design of the car is such that there are very few blind spots. The seat is very comfortable, and it is just comfortable to drive. The turning radius is great and it is very responsive. I live in a city with hills and I love the hill assist feature--no rolling back! It is also great for city parking. The temperature control and sound system are wonderful. The gas mileage is fantastic! And this is a car which holds its value and comes with years of mainteance support, keeping the mainteance costs lows. The only two areas that could be improved are consistent with what the fancy car reviewers say: 1) it could go from 0 to 60 a little faster. That being said, it is consistent with other value cars that I have driven. No better but no worse. 2) The gear shifts in lower gears are a little louder than they could be. There are quieter cars out there. But overall this is car is a great value! I needed a car at a good price, that would hold its value, had great fuel efficiency, high safety standards and low maintenance costs. This car wins in all those categories. And it is fun to drive.

The visibility is poor because of the high dashboard and small windows. Visibility is especially poor at night due to the terrible LED low beam headlights!

This is especially bad while going down hill which reduces the visible distance to about 1 car length.  At times you can literally see pedestrian's leg without a hint of their torso. It's almost funny if it weren't so dangerous.  I hear the low beams cost upwards of a grand to replace too, can't wait for that!

 on 04/30/17 07:36 AM (PDT),Calvin Winnager ,2016 Toyota Corolla Sedan LE Plus 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),CVT performance is disappointing," Overall, the 2016 Corolla LE is a reliable, adequately functioning car, ride is comfortable.  At low to moderate acceleration, the CVT functions well.  At moderate to hard accelleration, the CVT forces you to learn to accelerate from a stop.  For your safety, I suggest you not attempt to merge into high speed traffic from a full stop.   If you floor it, it will not shift until 5000RPM.   It acts like it is hung in its current gear while accelerating slowly.  What you learn to do is pre-select your level of desired acceleration, rev the engine the related RPM(2000, 3000, 4000), hold it there while the CVT goes through its shifting.  However, at highway speeds (55-75mph), it performs well at maintaining its speed.  I contacted the local Toyota service department and they assured me this performance by the CVT is as designed by the Toyota engineers.

At low to moderate acceleration, the CVT functions well.  At moderate to hard accelleration, the CVT forces you to learn to accelerate from a stop.  For your safety, I suggest you not attempt to merge into high speed traffic from a full stop.   If you floor it, it will not shift until 5000RPM.   It acts like it is hung in its current gear while accelerating slowly.  What you learn to do is pre-select your level of desired acceleration, rev the engine the related RPM(2000, 3000, 4000), hold it there while the CVT goes through its shifting.  However, at highway speeds (55-75mph), it performs well at maintaining its speed.  I contacted the local Toyota service department and they assured me this performance by the CVT is as designed by the Toyota engineers.

I'd honestly never thought of Toyota because it's so soccer mom-ish but I began to love the new styling every time I saw the new body style. I had heard that buying a Toyota would keep me in the car for at least 5 years headache free.I've got almost 5000 miles on the car now and loved every minute I've spent in the car! My few less than positive comments follow:1. The braking is almost too soft. I find myself pressing on the brake and startled when I'm coming too close to the car in front of me and then quickly pressing much harder to actually stop the car. I've done this several times now and can see it's a problem in the event I have to react to split second stopping. I feel like I need to take it to a empty parking lot and practice emergency stops so I can adjust to the really soft brake pedal.2. I find the car has that lag when you stomp on the gas to accelerate into traffic from the on ramp. It almost feels like it LOSES energy when I step on the pedal then doesn't follow up with rapid acceleration but slogs into traffic which is frustrating. I don't know about torque and rpms and such but a V6 should have more power than this at a low speed to rapid acceleration, I thought.I live in Colorado. When driving into the mountains it has plenty of power to climb the hills and the transmission is smooth and perfectly silent. I love the ability to take it out of auto D and switch the gears to slow my descent which is a necessity here.I bought it in May so hope that this car is solid on snowy roads, that's why I went back into an SUV from a sedan. Last winter, I'd rent a AWD/4WD when driving to the mountains because I had a FWD sedan so when I needed a winter car I'd rent one. So, I compared the Nissan Pathfinder, the Buick Enclave and the Ford Explorer in true winter conditions. The Buick is a tank and grippy. I actually relaxed during a tricky winter drive in the Buick. Next in line was the Explorer which has the control to switch to ""snow"" and when I put that into play, it felt solid and reliable on slick, snow packed roads but still had a ""tinny"" feel, the opposite of a tank. The Nissan would hit a patch of snow pack and slide sideways making for a sickening experience among other really questionable build issues that convinced me this car is a non starter. Bottom line, I hope my Highlander feels solid like the Buick this winter.The Buick has a pretty interior, lots of accent lighting and finishes in the cabin to make you feel like you're in a very expensive high end vehicle. The Highlander has a utilitarian interior cabin with just a few details to make it feel more like a car than a truck but it stills looks utilitarian. The center compartment is huge and I find I access it a lot like my purse...the tray has the things I need daily, and the ""bottomless"" part catches all the stuff that I leave in the car so I reach deep into it and rake through stuff to find what I'm looking for. It literally can conceal a large purse or your laptop case (and probably an airline carry on!) so it's useful for concealing things left in the car.The sound system is just adequate, the range of sound is in the middle range and a narrow range at that, just adequate. The road noise is noticeable but acceptable.The doors have a hollow sound when you shut them which is surprising.The bluetooth speaker system tied to my phone is a muffled sound and coupled with road noise, it's underwhelming.I chose the Highlander over the Buick because I felt like the Highlander is going to take me much further down the road with fewer repair/maintenance headaches but it was a close call between the two. The Toyota care program tilted my decision in it's favor. I'm all for someone else taking care of and paying for the regular maintenance for the first two years.In town driving on mostly 35mph streets gets around 22; getting into stop and go drive time on interstate roads gets 24 and all out interstate driving at 75mph gets over 30. This is almost the same as my little 4cyl FWD sedan!Bottom line, I'm hoping the car doesn't disappoint in true winter driving and I'm prepared to switch to winter tires to get the performance I need but I hope I don't have to spend the money and the time to switch tires twice a year.

It literally can conceal a large purse or your laptop case (and probably an airline carry on!) so it's useful for concealing things left in the car.The sound system is just adequate, the range of sound is in the middle range and a narrow range at that, just adequate. The road noise is noticeable but acceptable.The doors have a hollow sound when you shut them which is surprising.The bluetooth speaker system tied to my phone is a muffled sound and coupled with road noise, it's underwhelming.I chose the Highlander over the Buick because I felt like the Highlander is going to take me much further down the road with fewer repair/maintenance headaches but it was a close call between the two. The Toyota care program tilted my decision in it's favor. I'm all for someone else taking care of and paying for the regular maintenance for the first two years.In town driving on mostly 35mph streets gets around 22; getting into stop and go drive time on interstate roads gets 24 and all out interstate driving at 75mph gets over 30. This is almost the same as my little 4cyl FWD sedan!Bottom line, I'm hoping the car doesn't disappoint in true winter driving and I'm prepared to switch to winter tires to get the performance I need but I hope I don't have to spend the money and the time to switch tires twice a year. Everything else I'm overall content with and happy with my purchase.","[('Toyota program', 'program'), ('c program', 'program')]","['rapid acceleration', 'hollow sound', 'low speed', 'more power']","[['year', 'car', 'love'], ['one', 'new', 'love'], ['year', 'car'], ['nt', 'miles', 'minute', 'car', 'love'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt', 'second', 'one'], ['like', 'take'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt', 'like'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'take', 'love'], ['nt', 'bought', 'car', 'now', 'road', 'sedan'], ['nt', 'car', 'one', 'sedan'], ['nt'], ['tank'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['nt', 'now', 'road', 'tank'], ['car', 'conv'], ['nt', 'like'], ['nt', 'like', 'vehicle'], ['nt', 'like', 'car', 'truck'], ['nt', 'like'], ['nt', 'car'], ['car'], ['range'], ['road'], ['one', 'road'], ['nt', 'like', 'take', 'road'], ['nt', 'year', 'one'], ['drive', 'nt', 'road'], ['nt', 'year', 'car', 'one', 'sedan'], ['nt']]","[('car owner', 'owner'), ('soccer mom', 'mom'), ('body style', 'style'), ('parking lot', 'lot'), ('brake pedal', 'pedal'), ('auto D', 'D'), ('FWD sedan', 'sedan'), ('winter car', 'car'), ('winter conditions', 'conditions'), ('winter drive', 'drive'), ('slide sideways', 'sideways'), ('sickening experience', 'experience'), ('build issues', 'issues'), ('end vehicle', 'vehicle'), ('Highlander cabin', 'cabin'), ('center compartment', 'compartment'), ('laptop case', 'case'), ('sound system', 'system'), ('road noise', 'noise'), ('speaker system', 'system'), ('road noise', 'noise'), ('maintenance headaches', 'headaches'), ('mph streets', 'streets'), ('sedan!Bottom line', 'line'), ('winter driving', 'driving'), ('winter tires', 'tires')]","['first consideration', 'little sedan!Bottom line', 'several times', 'So compared', 'Bottom sedan!Bottom line', 'high end', 'lag stomp', 'then pressing', 'accent lighting', 'then follow', 'need daily', 'true winter conditions', 'interior Highlander cabin', 'actually stop', 'overall content', 'probably winter carry', 'almost feels', 'close call', 'bottomless part', 'went back', 'next winter car', 'actually relaxed', 'tricky winter drive', 'Last winter', 'really questionable build issues', 'prepared to switch', 'new styling', 'true winter driving', 'questionable build issues', 'rapid acceleration', 'interstate roads', 'still had', 'very expensive end vehicle', 'soft brake pedal', 'take further', 'second stopping', 'regular maintenance', 'large purse', 'narrow range', 'honestly thought', 'tinny feel', 'new body style', 'utilitarian Highlander cabin', 'snowy roads', 'positive comments', 'never thought', 'interstate winter driving', 'middle range', 'quickly pressing', 'empty parking lot', 'literally conceal', 'first years', 'fewer maintenance headaches', 'expensive end vehicle', 'muffled sound', 'other build issues', 'on ramp', 'really soft brake pedal']",neg

First of all compared to my CR-V 2010 (EX-L with Nav) this car is definitely more refined, except the nav which is actually more functional on the 8 yr old Honda. The quality of materials is top notch and the seats are comfortable for me (5'6"" tall medium build). The acceleration is smooth and effortless and the visibility, even without all of the active safety features in the XLE, is good. The storage options are great and the second row captains chairs are awesome. One issue is the third row seats do not have a latch system. This may be an issue for some and I know I wish they had LATCH .   The car is quiet and handling is solid. For gas milage I have been getting about 18 mpg with mixed driving. I was hoping for a little bit better but I am ok with it, especially with the fact it takes regular unleaded fuel, not premium.  Some annoyances are that the climate system makes this low buzzing noise sometimes quite often. (Updated: that seems to have stopped or I have blocked it out. Either way I don't hear it anymore.) The voice control system is a total joke. I have not gotten it to ever work right and so I just don't use it. I had a similar system in my CR-V and it did work slightly better but I still don't use it. Bluetooth works consistently until recently. Now it sometimes disconnects and the radio will actually reset itsef!  An issue that is minor but annoying is the fact that using the audio is a little bit of a pain. Update: this seems to have gotten worse despite a software update. The up arrow on the steering wheel goes through the channel list in reverse order but as seen on screen whereas it goes through audio songs on bluetooth in the opposite direction. I have made the highest number stations at the top so using the steering wheel arrows to change channels now makes sense.  The nav is a miserable endeavor.  The list of deficiencies is long: there is no way to mute the nav voice guidance, you cannot scroll on the map, the traffic info is useless, the directions are often silly, I bought a mount for my iPhone and  just use that.  Be ware that Toyota has no plans to update to any sort of apple or google CarPlay/android auto. Bottom line don't buy this car for the tech.  The screen is nice on the nav but the thrills end there.  Finally another annoyance is the text message notifaction. At first it seems great: you can hit the read button and it will read the text to you, however imagine being on a group text?!?! There is annoying chime that sounds with every new text, sometimes you just want to silence it but you cannot unless you turn off the feature for every single text!! Nice touches that I love include power lift gate, accessible rear window, it opens on its own, push button start and one touch locking/ keyless entry, large center storage, beautiful and logical set up driver cluster (speedometer, tachometer etc).  In snow and rain this car is a beast. I feel very safe.  One last thing, the car has developed a creaking noise when giving over speed bumps.  Service dept couldn't reproduce it. I will keep on it.  Would I get this car again or recommend it? Yes I would.  It is a good car that is well appointed and can see myself driving for many years.  The 2017 is going to be updated with new safety tech for xle model and is worth a look.  The nav will continue to be a nightmare I am sure but not a deal breaker for me.  Updates. Brakes replaced at 28K, 400 dollars at a local shop. 800 at Toyota. New tires were $1000 at a local shop.  Have serviced car regularly at Toyota except brakes and tires for a few hundred dollars total over the past 3 years. Next service will be at a local shop. Toyota reliability is true.

I will say that when I purchased the vehicle on the lot I was a little disappointed in the fact that I had to buy the BASE model in order to get the bench in the middle row.  However, I needed that one extra seat.  And unfortunately, the base model didn't offer factory leather seating according to my dealership.  Cloth seats are NOT ideal for people with children.  That being said, my husband and I just agreed that once we got tired of the need to constantly clean the seats or fed up with how bad they look, then we would pay $2000 to a local company to transition all seating in the car to leather.  While I will do this, I still know that there is nothing better than the factory installing the leather.  I'm sure I will run into problems along the way.  This complaint is simply a cosmetic issue.  However, I have discovered a real safety concern over the past 16 months that I've had my Highlander.  On 3 separate occasions, I missed an accident by a mere second -- literally.  I am only 5'1"" tall, and unfortunately the way that the BULKY side mirrors are it creates a MAJOR blind spot for me in the front of my car when making turns based on my height in the seat.  At first I fooled around with the seat adjustments to try to figure out how to raise the seats, and couldn't figure it out.  Finally, when I brought it to the dealership for an oil change, I told the service man that if they couldn't figure out how to raise my seat for me, then I was probably going to have to sell the car.  I have 3 children that I drive in that car every day and I simply couldn't continue to take the risk.  Fortunately, he showed me that one of the seat adjustment buttons actually allowed the seat to go front to back AND up and down.  So, I was able to get a little more height in the seat.  And it is helping a little.  But the judgement is still out because we just figured this out two weeks ago.  Honestly, if I have one more scare with this. I will sell the car.  Of course, some might say just put a seat cushion to help lift you up.  However, when I paid over $30,000 for a car, I don't think that I should have to use a $10 seat cushion to make it safe.  I think it also doesn't help that the side line of the windshield is bulky as well.....adding to the issue of blocking the view of cars that are literally in front but to the side of you on the driver side.  I have literally watched cars coming at me from a distance and watched how at a certain point they simply DISAPPEAR from my view completely for a second.  I am a very conscientious and defensive driver.  I have had many cars over the years, and have NEVER experience a blind spot in the front side of my car.  My only other complaint is that I don't find that the AC blows extremely cold air. It never really has from the beginning.  If I end up having to get rid of the car, it will be a shame because overall I like the car.  I hope Toyota does something to redesign for future models.",3.0,"Safety Concern-Blind Spot In Unique Area Overall, I like my Toyota Highlander.

 on 01/08/18 15:56 PM (PST),S. Tessmann ,2017 Toyota Highlander SUV XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),"Update for ""Computerized Fiasco"" Review"," My original review entitled, ""Computerized Fiasco, Warranty Nightmare"" pertained to our experience in getting a malfunctioning radio repaired under warranty.  The so called ""speed-activated"" radio volume was erratic and not being regulated by the vehicle's speed.  My review was influenced by our frustration getting this fixed promptly under warranty.  Ultimately, the dealer did set up a ""one-visit"" appointment to diagnose the issue and had a replacement on hand.  The diagnosis confirmed there was an erratically fluctuating current (loose circuit?) in the system.  The warranty repair invoice indicates the radio unit was replaced and it now appears to be functioning per specification.Bear in mind we are in our mid 60s and technology-aversive.  That does not mean we have difficulty using new technology.  We just don't see the need and have little use for much of it.  Unfortunately, there is not a lot of choice in new vehicle packages.  My position on this is . . . lean to drive!  Don't depend on cameras, warning lights, and radar this, radar that to correct your mistakes when you're not paying attention!!!  And, especially don't make me pay a lot extra for all this wizardry.   And self-driving cars?  Don't even go there !!!Per my original review, I am still unhappy with the ""radar"" cruise control feature.  I have to physically turn it off every time I engage the cruise control, which is an extra step.  Other issues:  Too much complexity (too many features) in the computerized dash controls.  This can be very distracting while driving.  My only other complaint is I don't like the leather seats.  They are uncomfortable.  However, it's what my wife wanted and we have differing views on this.  Otherwise, the Highlander does drive nicely.  For the size vehicle, I would like the gas mileage to be 3-4 mpg better than it is, but 21 mpg is not all that bad.Another issue I have relates to my wife's prior Highlander, which will eventually pertain to the current model.  Cost of replacing struts is very excessive.  Most repair shops more than double the actual retail cost of the struts and then charge $110-$120 per hour for labor on top of that, resulting in estimates of over $1,000.  This is a far cry from the old days of replacing worn shocks.ORIGINAL REVIEW:     My wife wanted leather seats so we purchased the XLE model, which comes with electronic and computerized everything.  Although we paid for it, we will never use nor did we want 80% of the electronic wizardry that comes in this model.  Lots of computerized stuff ultimately equates to lots of opportunity for malfunctions.  The radio is ""speed-activated,"" meaning the volume is supposed to increase gradually as the vehicle speed increases to compensate for road noise .  The radio in our highlander is defective.  The volume erratically and abruptly increases and decreases at any speed, even while the vehicle is idling.  It's enough to drive you nuts.  The vehicle is under warranty so I told the dealership I wanted the system replaced in one visit.  In response, I got a lot of rigmarole about protocol and was told the system would need to be removed and sent off for diagnosis.  I told them this was unacceptable as it meant several 100-mile round trips to the dealership.  To no avail.  They arranged a Saturday morning appointment but then told us they would need authorization to replace the system and since Toyota's technical service office is not open on a weekend, they could not get the approval.  The technician downloaded a software service pack that did not correct the problem.  I called the Toyota ""customer care"" center to lodge my complaint and insist that the problem be corrected in one additional visit.  It was like talking to a trained puppet.  More rigmarole about protocol and ""I'm sorry you are being inconvenienced"" and ""I am unable to guarantee the problem will be fixed on your next visit.""  Protocol before customer service, always !!  The vehicle also comes with ""radar activated"" cruise control.  Although functioning properly in our vehicle, it's the most worthless, vexing thing I've ever encountered.

When you unlock any door the car turns itself off.  Toyota says it is a security feature.  Other manufacturers handle security another way that is much more convenient and the car will not turn off.  It will only run for 10 minutes when remotely started and there is no way to lengthen the time in colder climates.  Most of the time to start the car using the FOB it takes multiple key press combinations on the standard remote FOB.  Thus you cannot tell when the car starts from a distance.

When you unlock any door the car turns itself off.  Toyota says it is a security feature.  Other manufacturers handle security another way that is much more convenient and the car will not turn off.  It will only run for 10 minutes when remotely started and there is no way to lengthen the time in colder climates.  Most of the time to start the car using the FOB it takes multiple key press combinations on the standard remote FOB.  Thus you cannot tell when the car starts from a distance.  So this is a useless $600 feature including installation at the dealer.  Again, overall this is a nice car just do not expect to have a useful remote start.

The visibility out the rear window is like the light at the end of a tunnel and is almost useless for seeing out the back. The rear window is designed for looks and style rather than safety visibility concerns. You cannot see cars directly behind with the rear view mirror.It is very difficult to see the images on the backup camera screen during the day and night. You have to strain your eyes to look at the screen to try and make out what is behind.  This creates a problem of spending too much time looking at the screen and ignoring the other surrounding areas. The screen's visibility is not great when it is darker, rainy or foggy. It is difficult to see low cars or any vehicle on the passenger side. The blindspots are major problems when preparing to change lanes. It is very difficult to see cars in the blindspot at night or during any rainy weather(the passenger side mirror is not enough). As you strain to see the car in the blindspot, you will ignore the cars in front and a front collision is possible.I wish I had bought the blindspot sensors and front collision sensors. I wish there was a retrofit.Because of the visibility problems, the Highlander is not the safest or easiest vehicle to drive. From what I know now I regret getting the Highlander without the blindspot and front collision sensors.It is very unsafe to accelerate too fast on the Highlander.

I really like the Mercedes but reliability and high maintenance cost were are a major issue.  With the only dealer around 40 minutes away, this would be a problem.   Same goes for the BMW, very nice but high cost of maintenance and dealer location.  Rear passenger entry for both the MB and BMW are difficult for adult men with feet larger than size 8.

Rear has heated seats and temperature controls along with a nice panoramic sunroof, and pull up privacy screens on the windows.  Leg room is the best I've seen in any vehicle in its class.  On to the not so good:  Gas mileage is pretty dismal around town which is most of my driving.  I'm not lead footed and I get around 15 mpg.  Steering load seems opposite of what it should be, very light at high speed and as you brake / turn at lower speeds it gets heavier.  The infotainment system is just horrible.

 on 02/23/17 13:10 PM (PST),kstanley ,2016 Toyota Highlander SUV LE 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Highly recommend the Toyota Highlander!," We've had our 2016 Highlander for just under a year now, and we love it. We traded in our 2013 Corolla when we had our first child and we needed something with much more space for all the new things we had to tote around for baby. We researched 4 different brands of cars; Chevrolet, Jeep, Toyota and Ford. The Chevy and Jeep had poor reviews ranging from the Chevy Traverse catching on fire 2 days after having it and the Jeep Grand Cherokee having issues with also catching on fire and having an issue with it's parking brake not holding and rolling away. It came down to the Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander or 4-Runner. The Ford was slightly less money but after I read the reviews on the Toyota (and being a previous Toyota owner and loved my old car) my husband and I agreed upon one of the Toyotas. There was even a review from a mom who said that she was t-boned by a drunk driver in her Highlander and the vehicle rolled, she and her two children survived and the drunk driver did not. Sealed my thoughts on what I wanted, but we test drove each one anyway. The 4-Runner drove nicely and was spacious, but it felt extremely bulky and top heavy to me. Probably more well suited for someone who wanted to take it off-roading or out in the mountains rather than drive their kids to school and do family things.

We've had our 2016 Highlander for just under a year now, and we love it. We traded in our 2013 Corolla when we had our first child and we needed something with much more space for all the new things we had to tote around for baby. We researched 4 different brands of cars; Chevrolet, Jeep, Toyota and Ford. The Chevy and Jeep had poor reviews ranging from the Chevy Traverse catching on fire 2 days after having it and the Jeep Grand Cherokee having issues with also catching on fire and having an issue with it's parking brake not holding and rolling away. It came down to the Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander or 4-Runner. The Ford was slightly less money but after I read the reviews on the Toyota (and being a previous Toyota owner and loved my old car) my husband and I agreed upon one of the Toyotas. There was even a review from a mom who said that she was t-boned by a drunk driver in her Highlander and the vehicle rolled, she and her two children survived and the drunk driver did not. Sealed my thoughts on what I wanted, but we test drove each one anyway. The 4-Runner drove nicely and was spacious, but it felt extremely bulky and top heavy to me. Probably more well suited for someone who wanted to take it off-roading or out in the mountains rather than drive their kids to school and do family things.

It may be that 2007 was the low point of Toyota's quality slump.  I bought this car used at about 135000 miles.  From previous experience, that's not even halfway to end of life for a Camry.  At first it was a pleasure to drive -- leather interior, JBL sound, smooth ride with little engine noise.

The car keeps stalling out even while driving on a highway. I have almost been involved in a serious accident as a result. Toyota can't seem to get to the bottom of this matter. In the interim I am very frustrated as I am getting the run around between the manufacturer and the dealer. I plan on pursuing NJ Lemon Law in attempt to have my car replaced.After pursuing Lemon law and having my car inspected by a Toyota Corporate mechanic I was told that the issue is due to a faulty design in the fuel tank. When my car is parked even on a slight incline (in my driveway) with a full tank of gas, gas will leak out and compromise the charcoal canister. When the onboard computer system senses that there is a issue with the fuel system, it is designed to automatically shut the car as a safety precaution ""even while the vehicle is in motion"". Toyota then advised me not to fill my tank more then half until a solution to this problem is remedied.  I was told that all 2012, 2013 and 2014 Toyota Camry's (along with some other Toyota models) have the same faulty design in the tank.  As such, getting me into another  2013 or 2014 vehicle would not solve the problem. My claim was therefore denied. I am currently eagerly waiting for a class action suit against Toyota. I have since gotten rid of my Camry and purchased a 2014 Honda Accord. As miserable as I was with the Camry, that's how much I am truly loving my Accord! My negative experience with Toyota has and continues to spread and have an impact. I have since convinced many coworkers, friends and family members (many who have been long time loyal Toyota customers)  to switch over to the new Honda Accord.

 on 10/13/15 12:15 PM (PDT),Camry owner ,2015 Toyota Camry Sedan XLE 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),You get what you pay for!," I purchased the 2015 XLE V6 fully loaded with the technology package.  Lots of features to discuss.Performance:Acceleration is strong - this car has LOTS of get up and go!  The V6 will not let you down.  Just be sure to realize that when you're in the higher gears and drop the pedal, there will be a hesitation as the RPM increase in the engine is translated to the drive train.  Speaking of the drivetrain, shifting from gear to gear is very much a non-event - barely noticeable.  Dropping it into ""manual"" shift mode gives you some control over performance, but the car will still shift for you if you're exceeding limits.  Steering is softer than I'm used to (previous car was '02 Honda Accord).  The electric steering is very lightweight and allows some slop in handling, as a result road handling is lessened a bit.  Body sway is noticeable on highway entrance ramps.  Braking requires more pressure than the Accord.Comfort:All aspects are deemed ""OK.""  Front seats are stiff - not sure yet how they'll be on long road trips.  Back seat has plenty of legroom and supportive seating makes the ride comfortable.  Exterior noise is minimal, and for the first 1500 miles there have not been any noticeable vibrations (knock on wood).  Entering and exiting the car is easy as the doors swing wide open.  Careful review of the backseat entrance should be made by anyone with limited mobility.  Longer legs will need to be picked up before swinging them out in order to egress the vehicle.Interior:Instrumentation, controls, and design of the interior all get top marks. The car looks like a luxury car!  That having been said, the weak spot on this car is the storage.  Trunk size is sufficient, but interior storage is limited at best.  Coming from an Accord where there was literally storage everywhere you turn, the Camry is sorely lacking in this realm.  You get a panel console that doubles as a charging bay, the glove box is pretty much worthless for anything but the owners manuals, and the door storage bins will hold nothing bigger than a small umbrella.  The armrest console in the middle is nothing but one big bin.  In essence, if you have small cables (phone charging cables), small objects (I carry pens, chewing gum, and my daughter's hair accessories), or other items know that they'll end up in the big console without any sort of organization.  To find them while driving down the road is nearly impossible, so you either have to plan ahead or just wait until you hit a stop light.  As for the quality of materials, the leather used in the seating is fine, but the materials used for the ceiling panel is cheap.  The doors are part leather and part hard plastic.  Previous Toyota ownership shows that extreme care must be taken with the hard plastic as it scratches easily.  Those scratches are permanent and will not come out no matter what you do.  For a $30k+ car, I would think that Toyota could afford to finish the doors in leather and provide a better ceiling.  Safety:Luckily, I haven't had to test out the safety features yet, but from what I can see they will perform as expected.  The LED headlights are OUTSTANDING!  Vision at night, even rainy nights, is perfect.  The LED daytime running lights are bright enough to be seen in the sunniest of days, and on rainy nights help ward off the road glare of oncoming traffic.  As mentioned above, I have the technology package on my car which includes the blind spot monitor, lane departure warning, pre-collision alarm system, and adaptive cruise control.  The blind spot monitor and lane departure warning work perfectly, the later beeping softly when you get close to leaving the lane without a signal.  I have noticed that it will occasionally warn of lane departure when the road markings suddenly end.  The pre-collision does work.  If you're accelerating when the person ahead of you is braking, the car starts braking and the beeping starts.  Obviously, this is useful but it could be a real pain in the rear if you accelerate to change lanes when the car in front of you is slowing down.  I have only tried the ACC once and it seems to work well.Technology:The head unit is relatively intuitive to use.  Touch screens dominate the interaction between driver and unit.  Aside from AM/FM/CD Player options, the unit allows for satellite radio, Bluetooth input from cellphone/music player, USB flash memory, and ""Aux"" in options.  The Entune apps allow for use of cell phone data to play Pandora, IHeartRadio, Slacker Radio, as well as Facebook Places, OpenTable, and MovieTickets.  You can also check weather maps and forecasts, review sports scores, check your stocks, and locate the nearest or lowest price gas station.

I was able to change the greeting picture to something more meaningful to me than the Toyota logo,",4.0,"You get what you pay for! I purchased the 2015 XLE V6 fully loaded with the technology package.  Lots of features to discuss.Performance:Acceleration is strong - this car has LOTS of get up and go!  The V6 will not let you down.  Just be sure to realize that when you're in the higher gears and drop the pedal, there will be a hesitation as the RPM increase in the engine is translated to the drive train.  Speaking of the drivetrain, shifting from gear to gear is very much a non-event - barely noticeable.  Dropping it into ""manual"" shift mode gives you some control over performance, but the car will still shift for you if you're exceeding limits.  Steering is softer than I'm used to (previous car was '02 Honda Accord).  The electric steering is very lightweight and allows some slop in handling, as a result road handling is lessened a bit.  Body sway is noticeable on highway entrance ramps.  Braking requires more pressure than the Accord.Comfort:All aspects are deemed ""OK.""  Front seats are stiff - not sure yet how they'll be on long road trips.  Back seat has plenty of legroom and supportive seating makes the ride comfortable.

I have always owned Fords prior to my first Camry and will probably never go back.  My first Camry was an XLE and my wife loved it.  I wanted one a little more sporty so got the XSE model and it delivers.  I looks great and handles like a dream.  The V6 is powerful enough to get you out of any situation you may encounter.  I love the new instrumentation.  It is better then the XLE I had.  The XM radio is as good as any I have ever had.  The fuel economy is within reason of other cars in its class.  The only thing I can say I don't like is the road noise on the interstate at 70-80mph.  It seems a little loud in the cabin when trying to listen to the radio or have a conversation.  It is within reason though because I drove a Cadillac before getting the XSE and the Caddy was just as noisy and a lot more money.  The seats in the XSE are a little more restrictive then the previous XLE but I chalked that up to the sport package.  I also chauffer two grand children around and the back seat room is great for them.  All in all the Camry is a good deal for the money.   After having the vehicle 6 months now I am not pleased with the overall ride from the ""sport"" tires.  They are low profile & give a harder ride.  Also a rattle in the dash has become apparent and the dealership cannot seem to eliminate it.  On last thing is the Bluetooth seems to have trouble pairing with my phone, but, this could be a phone problem and not the car.I have had the car over a year now and am still quite pleased with it except for the tires that came on it originally.  They were just to hard and made an uncomfortable ride.  I took them off and put another set on and the ride has improved greatly.After two years the car still runs and handles well.

Love everything about it-----EXCEPT THE JUNK TIRES.  Noticed a bounce at low speeds almost out the door of the dealer.  Was in the shop at 375 miles on the odometer for 4 hrs to balance the tires.  Car returned to me and the balance was worse than when I took it in.  Back in the shop again at 560 miles for balancing.  This time, two tires are replaced.  The ride is a little smoother but still has a very noticeable tire balance problem--especially at city driving speeds.  Speeds of 60 plus is still noticeable.  These tires are the Turanza Bridgestone and have no business being on the market as a high value tire when it realistically is a cheap tire that has no business on a Luxury type Vehicle.  Can't understand what Toyota was thinking when deciding to use these junk tires on their finest automobiles.   It is almost a certainty I will be at the dealership weekly for balancing until they decide enough is enough and put some decent tires on the vehicle.  If not for the tires, I would truly have a vehicle with a Luxury feel to it.  Instead, I have a Luxury looking vehicle with a bounce in it's get along.Aug. 2016:   After several trips to the dealership trying to rectify the problem, they recognized the fact the tires were defective, even after replacing two of them with new Bridgestones.  This did not work and a thousand miles on the car, the dealership finally worked with me to put new Michelins on the car.  The car rides like it should now and i am happy with the end results.  Toyota should still get rid of using Bridgestone Tires.Aug 2017:  35,000 plus miles and still love the car with Michelin Tires.

Here are some pros and cons of this vehicle. To start, it's a sharp looking car; aggressive lines, low, and large wheels make this stand out. Further, the handling is not your typical Camry as they changed the rear suspension to double wishbone. It handles like an older E60 5 series; very well planted but supple on the highway. Speaking of highway, the mpg is ridiculous. At 75mpg I was averaging 42 to the gallon. Over the course of our trip we drove around 100 miles. To refill before returning cost me a whopping $9. Impressive. The Cons are big however. The transmission needs an office space printer style beating. The 8 speed hunts for gears like an old basset hound whose lost her smell. There's a sport mode with paddle shifters, but they may as well have been developed by Fisher Price. A long 1 second pause between shifts happens before the tranny decides to act. Especially from a dead stop, the delay is maddening. My gf's head was constantly hitting the back of the headrest from the jerkiness. If your in sport mode and you don't pull the paddle, it goes into auto immediately. Moreover, the engine is chintzy and harsh. It whines when pushed above 3k. The entertainment system left a lot to be desired as well. Developed in house, its touch interface was slow and the layout was wonky. So in summary, the new 2018 Camry is kinda like the old Pontiac Fiero. Great looks but underpowered, a terrible transmission (the same shared with the new Tacomas that drivers also hate), and cheap tech on the inside.

I am satisfied with the power and acceleration of the car despite the noise. Transmission could be smoother, but is quiet and can not be heard, maybe because of engine and uncalled for road noise. The exterior metal is thin. Looking down the sides of the car you can see the metal change/ripples as it approaches the seems/joints.  Shutting the Camryâs drivers side door you can see the panel vibrate/flex and I was worried about cracks forming in the paint, but the Toyota Service department told be it was thin for milage and the paint would be OK.  And it does get good Milage in the central Florida area.  driving in the Tampa Bay area I get about 33 mpg verified by calculations from the Optometer and the gas pump.  And have gotten 42 mpg driving to St. Augustine including the drive through the Orlando area. If you like technology, you will NOT be very happy about the Entune system.  I knew the Scout GPS was unreliable from all the reports I read before buying the car, so I bought a GPS with a bean bag that sits in the hole in front of the shifter and below the dash board.

The Entune sound quality NOT impressive.  The sound quality is somewhat better when you play Mp3s on a usb thumb drive, poor sound quality by blue tooth off the iPhone. (same music files on both) The Car will drop the grace note art when you put the Camry in gear, making you read text instead of briefly glancing at the Grace note icon.

It took me about 3 months before I bought it, because I wanted to make sure I was making a good purchase.I paid a great price for my car and I find the car very good. It is very gas efficient, has many safety items, but there is something that is bothering me so much, that is the transmission.

The interior design is horrible.  My 2004 Camry was much more comfortable.  On a test drive you spend little time to notice how comfortable you are.

 on 07/08/17 11:12 AM (PDT),DL Hatton ,2017 Toyota Camry Sedan LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Honest review.," I really like the car. It's the best car I could find for the money I paid and I've always wanted a Camry since  they started making them 20 miles away from me. I got it when they were clearing out the 2017 models to make room for the new ones, so I got a great price.  The only complaint I have is a little bit of wind noise around the drivers side window. Even though the LE is the base model, it has plenty of features to it and I didn't need or want most of the things found in the higher priced models. So I am very satisfied with the car and I'm glad I bought it.  It's not the most exciting car but at my age I don't need speed. And I didn't want a sports car, or a car that rode like one. I wanted a good, smooth riding, reliable car that will serve me well for a long time. It does everything well you expect from a car. After owning the car for a year I have some updated thoughts on the Camry. I think they just don't make  them the way they used to. Even though I like the car, it sure isn't perfect. I have wind noise coming from the drivers window and door. The dealership stated that  they would have to get a Toyota engineer to test drive it to determine if it's excessive. That's basically a way of saying they don't want to bother with it. It is excessive and it's rather bothersome, especially at interstate speeds. The dealership stated they hadn't had complaints about wind noise on this model vehicle but I have read reviews and many owners stated they had wind noise too.

Maybe I'll have another update some day.",3.0,"Honest review. I really like the car. It's the best car I could find for the money I paid and I've always wanted a Camry since  they started making them 20 miles away from me. I got it when they were clearing out the 2017 models to make room for the new ones, so I got a great price.  The only complaint I have is a little bit of wind noise around the drivers side window. Even though the LE is the base model, it has plenty of features to it and I didn't need or want most of the things found in the higher priced models. So I am very satisfied with the car and I'm glad I bought it.  It's not the most exciting car but at my age I don't need speed. And I didn't want a sports car, or a car that rode like one. I wanted a good, smooth riding, reliable car that will serve me well for a long time. It does everything well you expect from a car. After owning the car for a year I have some updated thoughts on the Camry. I think they just don't make  them the way they used to. Even though I like the car, it sure isn't perfect. I have wind noise coming from the drivers window and door. The dealership stated that  they would have to get a Toyota engineer to test drive it to determine if it's excessive. That's basically a way of saying they don't want to bother with it. It is excessive and it's rather bothersome, especially at interstate speeds. The dealership stated they hadn't had complaints about wind noise on this model vehicle but I have read reviews and many owners stated they had wind noise too.

They made me wait 90 minutes then told me that I would have to bring it back because they didn't have time to check the AC.  90 minutes to change the oil and rotate the tires?!

All of the annoyances found in present day designs are present in the Camry. Among them are: poor rear visibility and colossal blind spots due to enormous headrests and steep windows; cheaper materials [the rear seat is 2/3's vinyl, even though it's supposed to be cloth]; slippery, unstable-feeling electronic steering, etc.Starting with the engine, Toyota uses what its salespeople refer to as ""chain drive"", which means that Corollas and Camrys use a a timing chain rather than a belt [which can break, causing catastrophic damage to the engine]. That's good. It's more reliable. Unfortunately, it also makes the engine noisy. Diesel engine noisy. Of course, the manufacturer can reduce that noise to inaudibility, but that costs extra money. I found that the Corolla engine noise was really loud inside the cabin. The Camry was less noisy, but there's more to the story. I tested four different Camrys. Three of them were tolerably quiet. The one that I ordered from the factory has turned out to be loud. Clattering, dieseling loud. Even worse, in cold weather, it takes a long time for the car to warm up. The colder the temperature, the longer it takes for warm up. How long? Five to ten minutes. Yep. That's sitting, burning gas, not moving for ten minutes - like some 1952 Rambler. Of course, I took the car to Toyota service. They explained that the long warm up is due to the use of a timing chain. They said it takes that long for the oil to warm up enough to allow the cam shaft and the timing chain to reach operating temperature. And, yes, the noise levels were ""normal"". In fact, they found all problems to be ""withing normal operating standards and parameters"". The lessons here are that [1] there seems to be considerable Camry car-to-car variability, and [2] whether a manufacturer gives you a one day or a lifetime warranty, they can get out of fixing a problem by simply claiming that an issue's ""within normal operating standards..."".Heading into the cabin, you'll find that the seats are cheap, hard, and uncomfortable. Don't plan on any long trips. I ordered cloth seats. The 'cloth' is actually slippery polyester, with extended sections of plain vinyl. As a result, if you use seat covers, they'll slip and slide so much that they verge on making driving unsafe. Even worse, Toyota seems to have the largest and widest head rests in the industry. I've compared. Toyota's head rests seem to be made for Godzilla. They far wider than those used by Honda, Mazda, Hyundai - pretty much everyone. Forget about being able to see anything over your left shoulder. You can't. But, at least when you crash - which, sooner or later, you will - that massive head rest will give you 10% more whiplash protection than a 1976 Bonneville would.The heat duct for your feet isn't oriented low enough, so that even with the heat blowing full on, your feet will still be cold on really cold days. The stock radio and sound system are execrable. And I mean that. Not just bad. Really, really bad. Almost unlistenable. If you buy a Camry, pop for an audio system upgrade.       The ignition switch on the steering column is poorly machined and of low quality. It was like that in all four Camry models I tired. You'll be poking the key clumsily every single time you want to start your car. The leather covering the steering wheel is thin and of low quality, but the same as I found in all of the competition. Also, only the top third of the steering wheel is actual leather. The rest is 'pleather', although is seems to be of high quality.  The Camry's electronic power steering has as much unit-to-unit variation as its timing chain characteristics. Three of the Camrys I test drove had reasonably weighted steering. Of course, the car that I got has crazy slippery steering. Driving it always feels as though you're hydroplaning on a sheet of sheer ice.  The worse feeling is the one you get driving at highway speeds. Unstable and veering out of control.So, with all of these factors, plus whichever new problems might be lurking, waiting to appear and make my ownership of this lump of sheet metal even more miserable, I'd say that I fully regret ever buying a Camry. Unfortunately, none of the competition's all that much different or better. At least the Camry's got a real transmission; some of its competition offers only CVT's.If you're thinking of getting one, make sure you really look it over before you part with your hard-earned money.

Firstly, if you DO buy it buy it new but Ideally lease it. Toyota has gotten incredibly shifty about their warranties and their reliability has dropped. I am reviewing this car based on owning it and also based on working on the brand professionally. In the year that I bought this car used, my dashboard has melted and been replaced by Toyota under warranty. My engine burns 1.5 quarts of oil per 12,000 miles due to faulty piston ring design. They will not cover it due to a lack of oil change receipts and the nature of it being purchased used. The gas pedal had a recall that was performed due to it functioning incorrectly. All Toyota Water pumps will leak antifreeze which is considered normal by the manufacturer. The sun visor in this particular model is held up by a metal clip and actually mine fell down while I was driving on the interstate one day. My radio was designed without the JBL option and you cannot upgrade after you purchase your vehicle. The wiring harnesses are not included and they will not allow it to be performed. The radio I was stuck with has major issues - as do many of them on that model. The cd players don't read properly and I went through five of them both new and used. You will be unable to do anything other than upgrade to an aftermarket radio designed specifically for this vehicle. The interior design of this build was built incredibly cheap and lacks durability in all senses. The alignment of the drivers seat is off to the right so eventually you will notice the left side of your seat wear out. The air conditioning system has a bad habit of growing mold and smelling like death due to evaporator moisture. Toyota's legendary paint has once again failed on my vehicle. The clear coat is paper thin and scratching everywhere. Also in newer vehicles, you will find stone chips and rail marks on every single car, even new ones. Trade in value has dropped horribly with this model and I'm financially underwater on this transaction. Toyota factory strut mounts are notorious for failure - especially the drivers side front on this model. The drivers side axle is also an issue and has a tendency to make noise and fail. The transmission software on these cars has been flashed several thousand times due to bad programming decisions and hesitations. Every time the car is at the shop there is a new recall open on it. My rear view mirror peeled in half and I ended up replacing it with one from a 1999 Toyota Camry.

The clear coat is paper thin and scratching everywhere. Also in newer vehicles, you will find stone chips and rail marks on every single car, even new ones. Trade in value has dropped horribly with this model and I'm financially underwater on this transaction. Toyota factory strut mounts are notorious for failure - especially the drivers side front on this model. The drivers side axle is also an issue and has a tendency to make noise and fail. The transmission software on these cars has been flashed several thousand times due to bad programming decisions and hesitations. Every time the car is at the shop there is a new recall open on it. My rear view mirror peeled in half and I ended up replacing it with one from a 1999 Toyota Camry. I actually have stopped working on new cars recently, due to the unreliability of the automotive industry of today.","[('oil change', 'change'), ('change receipts', 'receipts'), ('gas pedal', 'pedal'), ('wiring harnesses', 'harnesses')]","['major issues', 'dropped horribly', 'scratching everywhere', 'functioning incorrectly', 'clear coat']","[['car'], ['new'], ['nt'], ['car', 'work'], ['nt', 'bought', 'year', 'car'], ['miles'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'one'], ['vehicle'], ['nt', 'new'], ['vehicle'], ['nt'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['like'], ['nt', 'vehicle'], ['vehicle', 'car', 'one', 'new'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['drive'], ['car'], ['car', 'new'], ['one'], ['nt', 'car', 'work', 'new']]","[('piston ring', 'ring'), ('ring design', 'design'), ('Water pumps', 'pumps'), ('sun visor', 'visor'), ('metal clip', 'clip'), ('JBL option', 'option'), ('cd players', 'players'), ('aftermarket radio', 'radio'), ('drivers seat', 'seat'), ('air conditioning', 'conditioning'), ('conditioning system', 'system'), ('evaporator moisture', 'moisture'), ('stone chips', 'chips'), ('rail marks', 'marks'), ('factory strut', 'strut'), ('Toyota mounts', 'mounts'), ('strut mounts', 'mounts'), ('side front', 'front'), ('drivers side', 'side'), ('side axle', 'axle'), ('transmission softw', 'softw'), ('programming decisions', 'decisions'), ('view mirror', 'mirror')]","['newer vehicles', 'actually fell', 'faulty ring design', 'new recall', 'actually stopped', 'single car', 'Firstly buy', 'bad habit', 'ring designed specifically', 'bad programming decisions', 'left drivers side', 'interior ring design', 'once failed', 'new cars', 'interstate day', 'automotive industry', 'read properly', 'legendary paint', 'working professionally', 'working recently', 'Ideally lease', 'unable to do', 'new ones', 'rear view', 'particular model', 'eventually notice', 'Technician Fires']",neg

Be careful when purchasing, take a long test drive. Make sure that at low rpms doesn't shake test on a smooth stretch of road so you can tell its not just road bumps.  UPDATE  By the time arbitration was held, vibration was much improved. Arbitrator would not drive car, so he had no way of feeling what I was concerned about.  I lost and no action was taken. Now it 11,500 miles, much improved, just a slight vibration when running at low rpm 12-1500 when car is cold and is in 5th or 6th idling along at 50 mph. At this point I'll probably live with it as I do like the look and feel of the car. Used no oil between 5,000 mile oil changes . Ride is a bit harsh as it is an SE model but the lousy OEM Turanza El-400 tires may be the reason. See reviews on this tire and avoid it if you can as Toyota does use other brands on their new cars.

 on 06/29/17 13:01 PM (PDT),John E ,2010 Toyota Camry Sedan XLE 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),90k Camry outperforms 2 previous luxury SUV's," I am writing this because I am so pleased with my 2010 Camry XLE.  From day I purchased it at 85k and continuing until now at 96k, this car has completely outperformed my previous 2 luxury SUV's, both of which had way lower miles and were several years newer. I am talking about a 2011 Infiniti EX with under 20k miles and a 2012 Cadillac SRX with under 40k miles. This older and higher mileage Camry is quieter, rides better, and just generally drives way better than either of those SUV's.  Even more astounding, I am getting this better performance at 1/3 the price of the previous 2 vehicles. Better car for way less money. This Camry has all the options so it is as close to a Lexus as you can get. I did think a 2008 Lexus ES350 probably was even quieter and rode even better, but the Lexus was all beat up and had more miles on it and still cost more than the Camry. Only negatives on the Camry are that the steering has loosened up a bit and I have to correct it too often for my taste. Is still comfortable to drive but wish steering was tighter. Also, passenger seat has developed an obnoxious rattle but only does it sometimes, thankfully not all the time. The real issue is do I enjoy driving the car? Before, when I had the 2 aforementioned SUV's, I usually drove my wife's 2014 Kia Forte5 because it drove better than either of mine. Now, I never drive hers anymore if I can help it because my Camry is simply more comfortable--the ride is so much quieter and comfortable both in town and on the road than the Kia or my former SUV's. You can just sit back and relax and drive all day without getting tired or beat up. Love how simple the controls are in the Camry. Virtually no learning curve at all. Navigation screen is right where I like it in the center stack in the middle so both front occupants can see it and do things with it. Camry has been totally reliable with no repairs at all during my 11,000 miles of ownership. The gas mileage even though it's a V6 is way better than either of the previous 2 SUV's and is nearly as good as the Kia Forte5. Gets 30ish on the highway and 25 around town which I think is astounding for a car of this size and power. With 18 gallon tank, have huge cruising range.  Backup camera works well and so does navigation system which has real time traffic. The value equation is huge here--this is the kind of performance and quality I was hoping for from the 2 SUV's but didn't get and ended up now with better car for 1/3 the price.

Have only needed to balance once and they're still balanced 6000 miles later.",4.0,"90k Camry outperforms 2 previous luxury SUV's I am writing this because I am so pleased with my 2010 Camry XLE.  From day I purchased it at 85k and continuing until now at 96k, this car has completely outperformed my previous 2 luxury SUV's, both of which had way lower miles and were several years newer. I am talking about a 2011 Infiniti EX with under 20k miles and a 2012 Cadillac SRX with under 40k miles. This older and higher mileage Camry is quieter, rides better, and just generally drives way better than either of those SUV's.  Even more astounding, I am getting this better performance at 1/3 the price of the previous 2 vehicles. Better car for way less money. This Camry has all the options so it is as close to a Lexus as you can get. I did think a 2008 Lexus ES350 probably was even quieter and rode even better, but the Lexus was all beat up and had more miles on it and still cost more than the Camry. Only negatives on the Camry are that the steering has loosened up a bit and I have to correct it too often for my taste. Is still comfortable to drive but wish steering was tighter. Also, passenger seat has developed an obnoxious rattle but only does it sometimes, thankfully not all the time. The real issue is do I enjoy driving the car? Before, when I had the 2 aforementioned SUV's, I usually drove my wife's 2014 Kia Forte5 because it drove better than either of mine. Now, I never drive hers anymore if I can help it because my Camry is simply more comfortable--the ride is so much quieter and comfortable both in town and on the road than the Kia or my former SUV's. You can just sit back and relax and drive all day without getting tired or beat up. Love how simple the controls are in the Camry. Virtually no learning curve at all. Navigation screen is right where I like it in the center stack in the middle so both front occupants can see it and do things with it. Camry has been totally reliable with no repairs at all during my 11,000 miles of ownership. The gas mileage even though it's a V6 is way better than either of the previous 2 SUV's and is nearly as good as the Kia Forte5. Gets 30ish on the highway and 25 around town which I think is astounding for a car of this size and power. With 18 gallon tank, have huge cruising range.  Backup camera works well and so does navigation system which has real time traffic. The value equation is huge here--this is the kind of performance and quality I was hoping for from the 2 SUV's but didn't get and ended up now with better car for 1/3 the price. Will probably stay with Camry when feel need for new wheels. One more note--USB ports are recessed in center stack and a pain to find.

I also felt the same and bought the car from a dealer earlier in 2013, a 2010 Toyota Camry. Now the miles is around 84000. I used to do my oil checks, vehicle check properly. Last month also i did there were no issues reported. All of the sudden this sunday the engine started to make noise. No rains, no animals no accident it started to behave on its own. The Check engine light and VSC light started to glow, i am shocked to see this happening. I went to TOYOTA Dealer they said this is a serious problem. A car having trouble in engine within 84000 miles I was also crazy to hear it.I called the Toyota motors they simply state the engine is out of warranty and they cannot help on this as they provided only the warranty for 5 Years or 60000 Miles. Even though I explained the situation they are not ready to listen anymore and they simply declined the request. With no other options left i have to go back to my Toyota Dealer again now he told about 6000$ after an hour talk he reduced to 4000$. The part is coming only around 1000$ but the service charge they are asking for 3000$. The problem is with the ignition coil and when i read it in the websites there are chances that the car could have been gone uncontrol and its a risk factor for anyone to drive.Toyota is not ready to accept this as its fault. I believe they need to value the customers and their safety. They feel after 60000 miles whatever happen to the owner they wont care. Its a bad attitude.   The review remains same..

The MPG is excellent if you drive moderately.  Low MPG is 30 in stop & go traffic.  The high MPG is 35+ at 75 MPH.  The transmission shifts smoothly & the RPM is typically 2,000 at all set speeds.  The speed shifter is handy & smooth allowing early downshifting on steep hills.  The engine has reasonable acceleration for a 4 cylinder & is easy to work-on.  Most of the negatives are interior related.  The center console is an oversized box which is easily solved with a $12 tray purchased online.  The entertainment controls are marginal.  The band & station selector is sized positioned well on the steering wheel, but changing bands causes the station to revert back to the first preset rather than retaining the ones selected.  The AM to FM volume disparity is high requiring that AM stations be boosted by 10.  Toyota could not solve either of the previous problems.  The rocker type air selector is difficult to use because you must look at the display as you cycle through the selections; a single button for each air selection is safer as they minimize your eye-time off the road.  The backup visibility is poor as the trunk is high.  Although, a highly rated backup camera can be purchased for $100 & installed by DIYers in a few hours.  The windshield has a lot of dashboard glare possibly due to its angle or paint gloss of the dashboard.  The visors require updating as the extenders are narrow & do little to block the sun with the visor on the side.  Why doesn't Toyota use sliding visors like GM?  They have been around for many years & work well.  The most serious issue, in this car, is coasting speed.  It is a safety issue as the transmission does not slow the car when your foot is lifted from the gas pedal.  Maintaining control down big hills requires downshifting & heavy braking.  Toyota claims it is done purposely to improve MPG.  While this problem may just be with our car but I have not read other reviews with a similar complaint & Toyota could not fix the problem.  Only one repair, besides 2 small recalls, was required in our 2.5 years of ownership.  A single element, in the rear window defogger, was open which caused radio static with the defogger on.  Turns out that the antenna is located in the rear window & was near the open element.  The defogger problem was finally diagnosed & it was replaced after multiple complaints.  Overall, this year & model Camry has exceptional reliability & is enjoyable to drive.

The issue is called a ""COLD START RATTLE"". Because our EPA has mandated cleaner & more efficient vehicles, the top end of these motors have many more moving parts (VVTI) The common problem now (with other brands too-Honda, etc) is a 1 second metal on metal ""rattle"" that occurs only at cold start (lack of oil to small moving parts in the VVT). It's loud /very noticeable and makes one wonder how long before the rattle progresses or wears out internal moving parts (ruins the top end or all of the engine). My Camry has this problem. My dealer acknowledged the problem and was instructed to replace (1) cam and did.. It did NOT solve the problem. Took it in again (Vancouver, Wa Toyota) , they kept it for a week (agreed it was still an issue) and sent me home with my Camry that still has the same pronounced cold start rattle. Dealer should have done the right thing and backed a customer in my opinion. Ours is a 2012 model with the 2.5liter & 40k on the car. Rattle started about 25k mi. I'm original owner and car has been serviced better than recommended. No changes made to engine on the new model/2015-exact same design. I submitted a Lemon Law claim to the factory and they simply denied my claim with no reasoning stated. So, needless to say, I'm an unhappy camper. Can't sell it in good conscience, can't keep a car with a flawed engine.  Read the forums, it's a fairly common problem on the 2.4 liter, 2.5 liter and 2.7 liter. So, I can't recommend the car.

It's for people who want to just get in, turn the key, and go, with a minimum of fuss. The Camry isn't designed to call much attention to itself. For one thing, there are too many of them out there. For another, they never win styling awards. That being said, the 2016 Camry (largely) fulfills the time-honored Camry mission.    When I bought this LE, I found the ride to be surprisingly stiff, but it did smooth out after a few weeks. The ride is quite good in nearly all circumstances. The car has generally been quiet, though it lets in a little more road noise than Camrys typically did.  Reliability has been rock-solid. Not a single issue in 40k miles thus far. Performance may not glue you to your seat, but it's more than adequate for driving, passing, hill climbing and merging. Fuel economy has been good as well. My driving is mainly on two-lane rural roads, and I average over 35 mpg overall. On a typical 20 mile trip on a rural road, I frequently get 40-44.  Handling is appropriate to this car's intended mission: good enough for typical driving, perhaps a bit better than its reputation would have you believe. Interior materials seem less ""luxurious"" than the Camry or Accord of 10-20 years ago, but are adequate. The driver's seat is comfortable enough for long drives. Visibility is very good. My iPhone pairs easily with the car's Bluetooth. Sound quality from the audio system is decent; perhaps slightly above average for cars of its kind. The trunk is large and easily accessible.  To my mind, this is one of the better-looking Camrys to come along. That may not be saying much, but I can say that I actually like the looks of this one. My dealership sold this one to me at a great price (4k under MSRP) and has given me outstanding service since then. This car does show signs of cost-cutting here and there, but overall feels pretty solid.  Will my next car be a Camry? I don't know. But I have only good things to say about this one. Toyota could have done a better job of tuning out road noise  and could have put better quality materials in the interior. Those are my only complaints. Good car, good value.

After owning this particular Camry for three months I find it mediocre at best.  The three worst problems are; ROAD NOISE, NAVIGATION (Voice commands) and FRONT SEAT COMFORT.  These three problems, alone, make road trips terrible.  The road noise level is so high that to hear the radio, the volume needs to be very high.  The Voice command feature is unusable at highway speeds due to the road noise. Combine this with the seat comfort and I don't want to take long trips.  I guess you need to go to a two week course on using the navigation system.  Nothing is intuitive, I guess that you can do a lot with this system but finding information, while driving, is difficult at best (I'm still trying to learn this system).  There are several other smaller problems; the display screen is washed out during the day by the sunlight, the digital speedometer does not match the needle speedometer and other small issues.  Keep in mind this is the XLE Camry (one step below the Avalon) and should much much better.  I hate to admit it but I rode in a Nissan Altima yesterday and found it much quieter and more comfortable than my Camry (I have never been a Nissan fan, maybe should re-evaluate the Nissan).  I'll take my 2001 Camry LE over this one any day.

I don't say that from a small perspective. I have owned at least 22 cars and trucks of different makes and models. I now own this vehicle, my 2007 Mustang GT and my wife's 2005 Prius, our second Prius. We were sold on the idea of a Hybrid. I don't want to give up my pony car. So we shopped. One day we were getting the Prius serviced RAV 4 which I would not have recognized as a RAV 4. Toyota has completely redesigned this vehicle. The color (metallic blue) and the look of the vehicle sold me right there. My wife intervened to make sure I didn't give away the farm. The salesman, Jose, didn't miss a beat. I asked him about some of the features. He offered me a drive. Long story short, we bought it that day. I have found that the handling on the road, mountain roads, local roads, and freeways is exemplary. The steering system is very refined in all arenas. There is a line of sight issue that produces a blind spot. This issue is mitigated by two little square mirror in the corner of the very large review mirrors in on the front doors. My question was about power. I love my V8. I love the way it sounds, the way it picks up and the way it drives.

I was  very interested in the new CRV since I just turned a 2014 in after a 36 mo. lease.  The current (spring/summer 2017) Toyota incentives made me look at the RAV 4 and I chose the RAV 4 Hybrid because the deal/value proposition was exceptional.  It's my first hybrid car so there's been a little acclimation required with all the extra noises a car with regenerative braking and a CVT entails but since my mileage is 37.8mpg in mixed driving I having no problems getting used to the odd sound or two.  I hate cars that have a no get up and go (press the accelerator and nothing happens).  This car ain't the quickest but if you hit the gas it actually responds well so I'm okay.  The only 'complaint' I have is that it definitely has less internal cargo space than the CRV.  The ride is very, very solid.  The handling is smooth, about what's to be expected in a small SUV.  The safety features are phenomenal especially considering the price.  I read lots of reviews dissing this car on one attribute or another but every one of the reviews ends with the same mantra:  If you want a car that combines value, reliability, and awesome gas mileage, there's only one, the Toyota RAV 4 Hybrid.Update:  Iâve had the RAV for five months and I continue to amazed and pleased with itâs mileage which is better than advertised and itâs Ride/comfort which wasnât part of my buying calculation.  My only complaint is that the NAV system isnât very good.  If Toyota put Apple Car Play in its cars/trucks theyâd be the âgold standardâ but alas weâre left with âEntuneâ a vastly inferior product.Update:  Itâs been a year.

It's my first hybrid car so there's been a little acclimation required with all the extra noises a car with regenerative braking and a CVT entails but since my mileage is 37.8mpg in mixed driving I having no problems getting used to the odd sound or two.  I hate cars that have a no get up and go (press the accelerator and nothing happens).  This car ain't the quickest but if you hit the gas it actually responds well so I'm okay.  The only 'complaint' I have is that it definitely has less internal cargo space than the CRV.  The ride is very, very solid.  The handling is smooth, about what's to be expected in a small SUV.  The safety features are phenomenal especially considering the price.  I read lots of reviews dissing this car on one attribute or another but every one of the reviews ends with the same mantra:  If you want a car that combines value, reliability, and awesome gas mileage, there's only one, the Toyota RAV 4 Hybrid.Update:  Iâve had the RAV for five months and I continue to amazed and pleased with itâs mileage which is better than advertised and itâs Ride/comfort which wasnât part of my buying calculation.  My only complaint is that the NAV system isnât very good.  If Toyota put Apple Car Play in its cars/trucks theyâd be the âgold standardâ but alas weâre left with âEntuneâ a vastly inferior product.Update:  Itâs been a year.  I still love this crossover.   I use it to deliver for Amazon Flex and itâs been awesome.

At the time I purchased my 2008 Tundra, new, my family owned three Toyotas, and my extended family owned 7 more.  I was quite excited to replace my 1999 F150 with a Tundra, planning to keep it for a long time, lots of miles.  I was quite disappointed with the result.  I purchased through Mike Johnson Toyota, Hickory NC in 2008.  Within a week of driving the truck I noticed unpredictable acceleration, as if the transmission would downshift and upshift at incorrect times.  At times, this was dangerous, say, when pressing the accelerator into a turn at an intersection.  I brought it to the dealership, and was told I would 'get used to it,' that 'it will learn.'  It never learned, and the dealer refused to acknowledge a problem.  I later moved, and a second dealer's chief mechanic agreed it was not normal, but also stated that when he had worked on such problems in the past, it did not always correct, and he would need the regional manager to weigh in.  Well, the regional manager never responded to my inquiry, and 8 years later the problem is not fixed, and never even officially acknowledged by Toyota.  I drive the vehicle only when I need, mostly on the highway, but it is by far the WORST DRIVING truck I have ever owned.Also, radio/aux input failed within 6 mo of purchase.

At the time I purchased my 2008 Tundra, new, my family owned three Toyotas, and my extended family owned 7 more.  I was quite excited to replace my 1999 F150 with a Tundra, planning to keep it for a long time, lots of miles.  I was quite disappointed with the result.  I purchased through Mike Johnson Toyota, Hickory NC in 2008.  Within a week of driving the truck I noticed unpredictable acceleration, as if the transmission would downshift and upshift at incorrect times.  At times, this was dangerous, say, when pressing the accelerator into a turn at an intersection.  I brought it to the dealership, and was told I would 'get used to it,' that 'it will learn.'  It never learned, and the dealer refused to acknowledge a problem.  I later moved, and a second dealer's chief mechanic agreed it was not normal, but also stated that when he had worked on such problems in the past, it did not always correct, and he would need the regional manager to weigh in.  Well, the regional manager never responded to my inquiry, and 8 years later the problem is not fixed, and never even officially acknowledged by Toyota.  I drive the vehicle only when I need, mostly on the highway, but it is by far the WORST DRIVING truck I have ever owned.Also, radio/aux input failed within 6 mo of purchase.

We just upgraded to a 7,000 lb rv trailer.  Adding 1,000 lbs for 2 bodies, food, drinks, etc will put us at 8,000lbs.  Time will tell having a 9,600 max tow. Improving  just a few features would do much to put this vehicle ahead of others.  The manual locking tailgate is one of the biggest issues with this vehicle.  It's very important to keep the tailgate locked.  If the tailgate is left unlocked, the camera for backup can be stolen in minutes costing owners thousands of dollars.  I store lots of stuff in and out of the bed - groceries, camping items, skis, suitcases, etc.  Almost useless having a key fob, when you're still required to get out keys and lock the tailgate.  To leave the truck in a secure manner one must not only remember to use the key fob to lock up the truck but also remember to use an old fashioned key and lock the tailgate. Recently I purchased an after market electronic tailgate lock.  The lock is now operated by way of the key fob - an enormous improvement. Yet one problem remains.  Toyota has failed to incorporate the tailgate into the door warning system so there's no warning if the tailgate has been left open.  There is no after market mod that can be done to incorporate a tailgate into the door warning system.  As mentioned in other reviews the instrumentation design and lighting is inadequate and outdated.  During the daytime and the period of dusk and dawn, without the headlights on, one cannot hardly read the instrument panel.  During daytime operations, even with the headlights on, the instrumentation looks quite Plain Jane - bland and dreary, almost a throwback to the 40s and 50s. Not only is background lighting poor, but design as well. Why would a driver want to keep an eye on engine rpm, oil temperature, pressure, water temp, etc?  A driver needs to see where he is going and the speed that he is going. Airplanes have secondary info such as oil pressure, fuel gauges, and oil  temp in the center of the instrument panel and primary instruments such as navigation and speed smack dab in front of their eyeballs!! Toyota needs to relocate the GPS info where the current speedometer and tach is located. Speed would be the only other information that a driver should have right in front of him/her.  That could easily be provided in the map feature of the GPS with digital readout like Ford had in the 70âs!! The door lock and window controls do not have background lighting.  How easy would that be to fix?? The truck has an old school radio antenna screwed into the passenger side fender.  I took it through a car wash and it busted off.  It needs to be manually removed for car washes.  Thankfully I was able to use a drill to get the broken base of the antenna out of the fender.  As the antenna broke off the fender, it proceeded to scratch the fender paint as well as it went flying through the air. A new antenna about $70. But thereâs more. The button for retracting the side view mirrors is in a bad place.  Hard to locate as it is right in the middle of a group of other switches. Not only is the mirror retract button in a bad location, but it along with the entire mirror adjustment panel does not have background lighting making it impossible to adjust or retract the mirrors in dark conditions!! So when I pull the truck into the garage at night, I have to either get out a flashlight or turn on the interior lights in order to see the mirror controls. Concerning towing, the tiny green indicator indicating engagement of the transmission for towing is hardly noticeable in the instrument panel.  I often don't notice I do not have it engaged when I begin towing.  There ought to be some sort of feature for the transmission that detects the vehicle is pulling something.  IF the towing button is not pushed there ought to be some warning that appears. One more thing concerning mirrors.  Toyota doesnât manufacture towing mirrors that include the same features that the optional side view mirrors have, such as blind spot indicators.  Cheap tires. At 20K miles, tires are shot.  A Tundra would be a very exceptional truck w/o these issues.  Spending $50,000 on a vehicle requiring drivers to manually lock and unlock a door (tailgate), purchase towing mirrors,  have controls that can't be seen at night, & an airbag warning lite that is on full time, U have to be kidding!!

 on 05/27/16 11:57 AM (PDT),M Tron ,2016 Toyota Tundra CrewMax Cab Platinum FFV 4dr CrewMax SB (5.7L 8cyl 6A),PLEASE Don't even consider the Big 3.," After 18 years of driving nothing but Dodge, I finally broke ranks and bought a Platinum CrewMax. This is without a doubt the most luxurious thing I have ever ownedâ¦or been in. Seriously. This thing is on par with my wifeâs Range Rover. Actuallyâ¦with the air-conditioned seats (which the RR doesnât have) it is in my opinion more luxurious. With the CM cab, it is like having a small apartment in the rear and we find ourselves opting to take the Tundra on trips rather than the RR.  If you are interested in the Tundra CrewMax, I would recommend shopping the used market from 2013 and under. Don't worry about getting a used truck, these things last forever (my parents both have 200K+ on the odometer). In 2014, for some stupid reason, Toyota did away with the slide and recline rear seats in the CrewMax which negates the plethora of behind-the-seat storage in the back. From 2014 forward, all the rear seats do is fold from the floor up which is slightly less than useless. Without going into detail, this truck has every option besides remote start. The interior is amazing, quiet, comfortable, well thought out, and just plain works. The parking assist sonar and camera are awesome. The Sat Nav/infotainment is very easy to setup, pair the phone (up to 4), and other Bluetooth players (up to 2). The ventilated seats are a God send in Texas.   And the powerâ¦my God you could jump start the Earth with the pulling power this thing has. And to the people moaning over mileage, you bought a 5.7 Liter V8â¦what were you expecting?

 on 10/27/15 23:26 PM (PDT),Brian Knapp ,2007 Toyota Yaris Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 5M),I get it - it's an economy car. But c'mon!," It's an okay car. You buy it because it delivers reliability, economy, and excellent fuel mileage. I understand this car is an economy car and it's no Lexus - much less a Camry. I'm not comparing this car to a nicer car brand - it's entry level and I understand that. However, it's still not a car that I would buy again after having driven one - even if I was in the market for an economy car.Pros:Economy - between the infrequent repairs (hasn't had any issues in nine years of ownership), the fuel economy, and the MSRP, it's possibly one of the cheapest to buy and undisputedly cheapest to run used cars out on the market today. It would make an excellent first car or a car for someone who just doesn't like driving and needs something easy to commute to work in.Reliability - In 9 1/2 years of ownership (we bought this car in April 2006), we have had zero issues with it. Nada. Nothing. It is a solid little car - that's expected of most Toyotas or Hondas however. Cons:Driving Dynamics - This car is scary on the highway. Trying to accelerate on a freeway entrance ramp is extremely difficult and downright dangerous. It's pretty peppy around the city, but trying to pass someone in this car is not for the faint at heart. Additionally, this car is from an era when electric assisted power steering was not quite as refined as it is today, so the steering feels pretty loose and a little ""off"" compared to older cars with hydraulic power steering. This gives the steering a ""numb"" feeling. I know this is a pretty subjective word to use, but the car just feels weird to drive. It's almost like driving a toy car or a golf cart. With an antiquated four speed automatic transmission, the engine gets pretty buzzy and it doesn't shift very smoothly.Interior -  Because of the starting price, I forgive the fact that there is hard plastics virtually everywhere, even on most places where your elbows rest. However, the interior is a bit too ""Scion"" in my opinion and not in a good way. Perhaps one of the biggest design flaws is the center mounted speedometer. Everyone in my family who has driven this car has had a few speeding tickets because it's easy to ignore the speedometer. I understand Toyota removed this in the newer generation of Yaris - thank goodness. Still - the center mounted speedometer is something that is hard to forgive and offers no benefit over a traditional steering wheel mounted speedometer. It's a classic example of form over function. Also, the seats are EXTREMELY uncomfortable - I often find myself hunching over the steering wheel with upper back pain because the seats are not very plush. The cloth is not soft and just feels really thin and not durable. The sound system is absolutely awful. Again - I get this is an economy car, but even my 2008 Toyota Corolla has a much better sounding stereo than the Yaris. The interior quality starts to show its age. We barely drive the car, but the plastics still rattle like crazy. The engine is extremely buzzy and there is a great deal of road noise in the cabin. The visibility is not terrible, but the exterior design gives it a pretty tall rear end, making the rear window a bit small. It also has EXTREMELY thick A-pillars which unfortunately block your view of pedestrians in the crosswalk. Overall, the interior of the Yaris is one of it's most pitiful downfalls. Safety - this car seems like the perfect fit for your teenage daughter or God forbid your son (don't get him a Yaris). However - just look at the side impact crash test scores. The Yaris did NOT come with side impact airbags standard. This car is a death trap in a T-bone accident, which is the deadliest form of accident. Not to mention, a lot of these Yarisi have virtually NO anti-theft protection. This car doesn't even have a chipped key - so anyone with a screwdriver can start the car. Toyotas tend to be one of the most frequently stolen car brand, so the fact that Toyota didn't put this basic safety feature in the car is shameful. Even my 2000 Ford Taurus had a chipped key and thats approaching 16 years old! I wouldn't recommend this car if you live in an area with high car theft rates. IF you do, consider investing in a steering wheel club and/or an aftermarket alarm system. Honestly - you can get that trademark Toyota reliability with just about any Toyota model out there. Consider investing in a 2000's era Camry instead (especially the '02-'06 generation) or a Toyota Corolla. You'll give up a few MPGs, but you'll get a safer, more comfortable car to commute in.",3.0,"I get it - it's an economy car. But c'mon! It's an okay car. You buy it because it delivers reliability, economy, and excellent fuel mileage. I understand this car is an economy car and it's no Lexus - much less a Camry. I'm not comparing this car to a nicer car brand - it's entry level and I understand that. However, it's still not a car that I would buy again after having driven one - even if I was in the market for an economy car.Pros:Economy - between the infrequent repairs (hasn't had any issues in nine years of ownership), the fuel economy, and the MSRP, it's possibly one of the cheapest to buy and undisputedly cheapest to run used cars out on the market today. It would make an excellent first car or a car for someone who just doesn't like driving and needs something easy to commute to work in.Reliability - In 9 1/2 years of ownership (we bought this car in April 2006), we have had zero issues with it. Nada. Nothing. It is a solid little car - that's expected of most Toyotas or Hondas however. Cons:Driving Dynamics - This car is scary on the highway. Trying to accelerate on a freeway entrance ramp is extremely difficult and downright dangerous.

Very reliable car, no engine issues, manual is almost... fun sometimes. Air works well, and stereo is not bad. Only issues I've had are the easily scratched panels, very annoying... also the panels where seat belts are get gauged. My Camry had a more resilient interior.

It's not a luxurious cruise, but I always felt safe, and the vehicle consistently performed as expected (a massive boon to the long drives is the flawlessly integrated bluetooth system).

Never happened in the Sentra...so I think they could do better about that.  The little pen section on the dash is a pain...it holds dust and crumbs and is a pain to clean.  I like closed, concealed space.  The cupholders are in a great position...up front and center on below the dash...but they were not smart enough to make a liner that could be removed to be washed.

 on 09/10/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Celica fan in DC ,1997 Toyota Celica Convertible GT 2dr Convertible,Almost perfect," I finally settled on this car after a year of shopping and have been happy with it ever since.  The cockpit fits like a glove, with plenty of leg room (I'm 6'2""), the car corners on rails, and has enough power to get out of trouble.  Surprisingly quiet with the top up and shear pleasure with it down.  The reviewers seem to think something is wrong with the styling, but I still have people walk up to me at lights and tell me how beautiful the car is. After seven years of driving this car, I only have two real complaints - 1.  The cup holders are in an awkward spot.  2. Toyota stopped making it.",4.75,"Almost perfect I finally settled on this car after a year of shopping and have been happy with it ever since.
