 on 01/31/16 12:27 PM (PST),Doug ,2000 Suzuki Esteem Wagon GLX 4dr Wagon,Best used car value there is!!!," This is my 2nd Esteem and a favorite of my current cars. I found my 2000 GLX wagon on craigslist for $2500.00 with only 92k miles. It has every available option and is in excellent shape. I bought the car as a spare vehicle to save miles on our much more expensive Toyota Sienna. My daily driver was a deisel VW Jetta. But after the Jetta had a mechanical problem I started driving the Suzuki. That was 9 months ago and now the Suzuki is my daily driver. I love the reliability, gas mileage and hauling capacity of this GREAT little car. I do all the work on my cars and I can tell you Suzukis were designed with a mechanics input. They are cheap and easy to service and the parts are still available. Don't let the fact that Suzuki motors is no longer in business scare you off. This has driven the prices down and that is a plus in my book. If you loved the reliability and ingenuity of the cars Honda designed back in the 80s and 90s you will love Suzuki. These are great cars and I'm going to be looking for more of them when my kids approach driving age. Update: Feb 2018....still have my Esteem GLX wagon. The car has 140k miles now and other than an idle control valve and alternator, the car has been trouble free. I hate to recommend one of these as a first car for a teen because new drivers tear up cars and that reduces the number of these great little cars. But my son is approaching driving age and Iâll have let him use this car (sigh).... On the plus side I loved my Esteem so much that I decided to buy another Suzuki. I now own a 2009 SX. This is now my daily driver and I love it too. All wheel drive and every option for less than $7k.  Love it.

This has driven the prices down and that is a plus in my book. If you loved the reliability and ingenuity of the cars Honda designed back in the 80s and 90s you will love Suzuki. These are great cars and I'm going to be looking for more of them when my kids approach driving age. Update: Feb 2018....still have my Esteem GLX wagon. The car has 140k miles now and other than an idle control valve and alternator, the car has been trouble free. I hate to recommend one of these as a first car for a teen because new drivers tear up cars and that reduces the number of these great little cars. But my son is approaching driving age and Iâll have let him use this car (sigh).... On the plus side I loved my Esteem so much that I decided to buy another Suzuki. I now own a 2009 SX. This is now my daily driver and I love it too. All wheel drive and every option for less than $7k.  Love it. Buy a Suzuki and get these guys back in the US car market where they belong.","[('GLX wagon', 'wagon'), ('Suzuki motors', 'motors'), ('GLX wagon', 'wagon')]","['still have', 'mechanical problem']","[['nt', 'car'], ['miles'], ['nt'], ['vehicle', 'miles', 'bought', 'car'], ['drive'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['car', 'love'], ['car', 'work'], ['drive'], ['car', 'love'], ['car', 'great'], ['nt', 'miles', 'car'], ['drive', 'car', 'one', 'new', 'great'], ['car'], ['love'], ['drive', 'love'], ['drive'], ['car']]","[('car value', 'value'), ('value t', 't'), ('sp vehicle', 'vehicle'), ('gas mileage', 'mileage'), ('mechanics input', 'input'), ('control valve', 'valve'), ('driving age', 'age'), ('wheel drive', 'drive'), ('US market', 'market'), ('car market', 'market')]","['greavalue t cars', 'excellenvalue t shape', 'idle convalue trol', 'firsvalue t car', 'livalue tvalue tle car', 'GREAT car', 'available opvalue tion', 'new wheel drivers', 'livalue tvalue tle cars', 'daily wheel driver', 'designed back', 'plus side', 'love value too', 'Besvalue t used', 'currenvalue t cars']",neg

One of the all time best cars I have ever owned.  Rugged, dependable, useful, economical, easy to work on, and FUN!  It only had one dangerous problem.  I bought it for cheap 18 months ago in the summer and put 2,000 miles on it by winter.  Everything went well until it got really cold, and then the brakes literally ""froze up.""  Rock hard pedal and no stopping!  Scary!  My brother suggested I plumb-in an extra length of heater hose and wrap it around the brake-power-booster.  I did.  No more hard pedal, not even at 25 degrees below zero.  Now this little wonder is closer to perfect than it ever was!  Update:  It is now the fifth of March, 2017, and ""Rattles,"" as my humorous wife calls the yellow ray of sunshine, is still going strong, although I had to finally break down and put struts, rear brakes, and rear anti-sway bar bushings on it.  Small price to pay for all it does for us.  It is our parts runner, loaner car, occasional clean metal scrap delivery mule, and otherwise general gopher and ever-ready default vehicle.  It's like a Swiss Army Knife on wheels.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Precise Japanese engineering and eye-catching Italian design.  What more could anyone ask for?  Oh, and did I mention?  It's good, clean fun!  UPDATE 09/06/2017:  Still going strong, although it might be time for a front end alignment because it's pulling a little to the left.  Also, the plastic headlight housings must be about as el-cheapo as you can get because I have to work the cloudiness out of them about every three months.  I looked up the price of new ones and found that they average $220 for the pair.  Ouch.  I watched a video about changing them, and discovered it takes several hours because you have to remove most of the front end body parts to do it.  So I guess I'll keep sanding and polishing the old ones.  But it's worth it.  My wife and I took it (it took us, whatever) on a long drive through the countryside as part of our 33rd wedding anniversary celebration, and I was reminded of how good it sounds when downshifting to climb a hill or pass a farm tractor.  Fun, fun, fun.  And when we finally got home, the gas gauge needle had hardly moved.  UPDATE 09/06/2018:  Since the brakes aren't dangerous anymore in cold weather, we got to drive it enough last winter to really see how it handles snow.

The little guy is still a blast in the summer though!",5.0,"Simplicity wins again. Simple design, simple layout, simply genius.  One of the all time best cars I have ever owned.  Rugged, dependable, useful, economical, easy to work on, and FUN!  It only had one dangerous problem.  I bought it for cheap 18 months ago in the summer and put 2,000 miles on it by winter.  Everything went well until it got really cold, and then the brakes literally ""froze up.""  Rock hard pedal and no stopping!  Scary!  My brother suggested I plumb-in an extra length of heater hose and wrap it around the brake-power-booster.  I did.  No more hard pedal, not even at 25 degrees below zero.  Now this little wonder is closer to perfect than it ever was!  Update:  It is now the fifth of March, 2017, and ""Rattles,"" as my humorous wife calls the yellow ray of sunshine, is still going strong, although I had to finally break down and put struts, rear brakes, and rear anti-sway bar bushings on it.  Small price to pay for all it does for us.  It is our parts runner, loaner car, occasional clean metal scrap delivery mule, and otherwise general gopher and ever-ready default vehicle.  It's like a Swiss Army Knife on wheels.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Precise Japanese engineering and eye-catching Italian design.  What more could anyone ask for?  Oh, and did I mention?  It's good, clean fun!  UPDATE 09/06/2017:  Still going strong, although it might be time for a front end alignment because it's pulling a little to the left.  Also, the plastic headlight housings must be about as el-cheapo as you can get because I have to work the cloudiness out of them about every three months.  I looked up the price of new ones and found that they average $220 for the pair.  Ouch.  I watched a video about changing them, and discovered it takes several hours because you have to remove most of the front end body parts to do it.  So I guess I'll keep sanding and polishing the old ones.  But it's worth it.  My wife and I took it (it took us, whatever) on a long drive through the countryside as part of our 33rd wedding anniversary celebration, and I was reminded of how good it sounds when downshifting to climb a hill or pass a farm tractor.

My kids can control their heat/air from the back seat & the vents are on the roof so they dnt play with them,they stay in the position i put them in. I like the rear wiper blade,nice to have in a 3d row to make it easier to see in snow/rain. There is a charger port in backseat as well,comes in handy for kids & their electronics. Alot of Space when putting dwn the seats. Back hatch opens very nice but i had one problem with it slowly shutting itself only happened one time.

Thanks everyone Your reviews really helped me understand my vehicle & that im not at fault for those things.",[],"['bad Reading', 'few things']","[['vehicle', 'great'], ['nt'], ['good'], ['nt'], ['like', 'now'], ['come'], ['one'], ['bought', 'new'], ['nt', 'vehicle'], ['vehicle', 'one']]","[('pass side', 'side'), ('side door', 'door'), ('space,3rd row', 'row'), ('wiper blade', 'blade'), ('3d row', 'row'), ('charger port', 'port'), ('family vehicle', 'vehicle')]","['front fenders', 'more half', 'low cost', 'had sometimes', 'Back hatch', 'really helped', 'back seat', 'rear wiper blade', 'same thing', 'slowly shutting', 'nice family vehicle', 'standing outpass side', 'same issues', 'only happened', 'amazing space,3rd 3d row', 'last complaint', 'reduced price', 'major issues', 'common problem', 'little things', 'nice to have', 'good space,3rd 3d row']",neg

Parts will still be readily available until 2025 so says Suzuki Inc., for the DYI driver though...",[],"['unfortunate fact', 'longer produces']","[['good', 'car', 'one'], ['year', 'car', 'one'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'year', 'car', 'think'], ['nt', 'work'], ['drive'], ['nt'], ['drive']]","[('year bumper', 'bumper'), ('bumper warranty', 'warranty'), ('dealer network', 'network'), ('DYI driver', 'driver')]","['Closest dealer', 'good one', 'drive away', 'still making', 'Never had', 'mechanical issue']",neg

In between the two dealerships was the New Sutliff Suzuki. Having owned 2 Suzuki's before I knew they were good, reliable, tough little cars... But what's this big BMW looking car on the lot? After a little deliberating and going back and forth between the Big two I choose the Suzuki. Why? It's just better all around. The lower cost is a bonus. Having the only one in the corporate lot is a big plus. It drives like a BMW (think 2002-2006 3 series), has build quality like a Mercedes (seriously, not kidding around it does) and all the safety features of an Audi A8 (10 airbags, EuroNCAP 5 star-higher than C300)!",5.0,"10 out of 10  - Not your typical Suzuki I honestly was looking at Mercedes and Audi, the C300 Sport and A4.
