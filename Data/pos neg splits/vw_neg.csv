Mechanically the car has been good but build quality needs improvement except for the paint job which is the best I have ever seen.  Problems we have had are: 1. Three headlight bulbs replaced. 2. Entire locking mechanism for power convertible top had to be replaced. 3. Coolant temperature switch replaced. 4. Four trunk pistons failed with the fifth now broken. 5. Seat belt retainer bezel broken off and replaced.  Fuel mileage is average that is 25 around town - less if air running and about 30 mpg at 65 mph if air not running.  Trunk space is inadequate and simple repair under the hood is difficult and expensive.,4.375,Quality Review We bought the car new in 2007 and are generally satisfied.

Until I finally got a tune up, that helped the chugging to stop, but then still got blue smoke coming out tail pipe. Not to mention, this is a turbo engine. My mechanic who specialize in European cars mentioned that turbo goes out every 75,000 miles. A turbo itself is $700 and labor? Probably $1,000. Eventhough, two Volkswagen dealerships told me I needed a new engine. Sitting in that driver bucket seat is uncomfortable. My lower back started to feel the burning and aching. The headlights are always loose, the rubber sealing doesn't reattach properly. The lightbulbs? They burn out frequently. My CD player skips or stops music for few seconds. I always had fast right turn blinker...even with all lightbulbs seemed to work. Too many problems! I'm not totally against the beetle, but she was a real BUGGER!

Stay away," I bought this car from a family member with only 16K miles and it was garage kept. It's a 2.0 convertible with automatic.  I can't begin to say how cheaply built this car is and VW should be ashamed of this product.  The structure of this car creaks and moans over smooth roads.  The driver's door handle (plastic) was cracked and this cracked the entire door panel.  Replacements are hard to find and expensive.  I got a new door panel and got metal door handles from ebay.  The driver's door latch switch broke.  This needed an entire latch and the switch lowers the window when opening and closing the door.  Without this switch say goodbye to the top. So I did this myself.  Then the rear plastics all cracked.  Then the flaps to cover the top frame broke and the top wouldn't move so I took them off to fix it. Then the rear window separated from the canvas.  I repaired the rear glass to save me the $2500 for a new top.  Once I had this fixed, then the rear driver's window regulator broke.  I took this to my friend and he fixed it for $300, but then the power top broke.  So I disabled the power top and do it by hand since I'm done fixing stuff on this car.  So it's fate is destined to be the in junkyard, but for now it's just rolling junk waiting for it's destiny.  All of these repairs are on a low mileage, well maintained car. Other driving impressions- it drives like a cheap economy car.  Braking is good.  Acceleration is below average.  Transmission and engine are still working for some reason.  Structure is poor as I described above. Interior storage is average. rear seat room is tight.  Paint is good.  30MPG highway.

I immediately sold my 2007 Triple White, and sought out a 2010 Final Edition.  I bought 1361 / 1500.  I wrongly thought it would have the great features of the 2007 Triple White.  It didn't.  Sadly, it does no have the ""red (LED)-light"" door lock indicator on both door locks (only on the driver's side  -- CHEAPENS the 2010 Final Edition.  The 2007 Triple white, with the same ""all white interior seating, had headrests with the great VW Beetle logo (same one that appears on the floor mats).  Classy.  The 2010 Final Edition does not have the logo embossed on the headrests.  AGAIN, the 2010 Final Edition is CHEAPENED.  Other bad things, at least to me:  A) Parts simply don't withstand the test of time - the windshield wiper motor has already died (after only 5 years), and it's about $700.00 to replace & repair.  Also, the headlamp covers crack easily, and have already started to fog;  B) the promotion of this car was terrible.  The 2007 Triple white had fantastic catalogs and brochures about the car. Yet, the 2010 Final Edition spend no promotion money at all.  NO catalogs. NO brochures.  NOTHING an owner, like me, can retain as part of the car's history.  Comparitively speaking, the 2007 Triple White put lots more money into it than the 2010 Final Edition, and it shows.","[('kid daze', 'daze')]","['immediately sold', 'small kid daze']","[['convertible', 'conv'], ['bought'], ['great'], ['drive'], ['nt', 'one', 'great'], ['year', 'test'], ['car'], ['nt', 'car'], ['one'], ['like', 'car'], ['nt', 'one']]","[('al edition', 'edition'), ('Limited edition', 'edition'), ('door locks', 'locks'), ('Beetle logo', 'logo'), ('floor mats', 'mats'), ('windshield wiper', 'wiper'), ('wiper motor', 'motor'), ('promotion money', 'money')]","['Other things', 'then driving', 'crack easily', 'already started', 'great features', 'spend all', 'no have', 'light door', 'great Beetle logo', 'wrongly thought', 'same one', 'Also covers', 'simply withstand', 'Comparitively speaking', 'more promotion money', 'interior seating', 'limited al Limited edition', 'same seating', 'fantastic catalogs', 'already died', 'Sadly have', 'Yet spend', 'bad things']",neg

Sliding Sunroof? YES! Convertible? YES! NO OTHER CAR HAS ALL 3 COMBINATIONS!!!Owned a 2008 VR6 model for over 5 years.  It did have a couple of annoying roof water leaks that I fixed. Thank goodness for vweosclub.com! No mechanical problems what so ever though. I did replace the battery(s). Note that the V6 model has 2 x 6V batteries in the trunk. To me, it's not a fast car off the line with the excessive torque and being front wheel drive. Beyond that, acceleration is decent, especially in sport mode. Fuel economy is great, as long as you're not in sport mode. The DSG transmission in normal drive mode likes to up shift too soon to help fuel economy. On the highway, that is fine with MPG averaging 25-28. For around town, I prefer to either put it in sport mode, or use the paddle shifters. Regardless, it's fun driving all year round. WIth the panoramic sunroof, I can have a warm car any time of the year. Too cold out? Keep the roof closed, and the sun will heat the car. Too hot out? Close the panoramic roof cover, and roll the windows down (or use AC). Temperature between 75-90? Put the top down! I love this car, and plan on enjoying for years to come...7 year update: still loving this car.

The DSG transmission in normal drive mode likes to up shift too soon to help fuel economy. On the highway, that is fine with MPG averaging 25-28. For around town, I prefer to either put it in sport mode, or use the paddle shifters. Regardless, it's fun driving all year round. WIth the panoramic sunroof, I can have a warm car any time of the year. Too cold out? Keep the roof closed, and the sun will heat the car. Too hot out? Close the panoramic roof cover, and roll the windows down (or use AC). Temperature between 75-90? Put the top down! I love this car, and plan on enjoying for years to come...7 year update: still loving this car. Did have usual issues with leaks, but figured out to to eliminate one by putting silicone between 2 overlapping seals in the back, and annually applying krytox to all seals. 75k miles and running like new.

I owned a 2015 Golf hatchback TSI briefly last year and loved the car, but my kids got tired of doing the Jenga thing with their backpacks under the hatch, so after a family road trip in the regular hatchback I bought a GSW TDI S with a 6MT.  That was a really good car.  However, with time I regretted that I was a little cheap and stopped short of getting the trim with heated seats and a panoramic sunroof.  I had been following the diesel scandal quite a bit being a TDI owner and had planned to hang on to that car for a while.  I was on a local dealer's web site a month ago looking for a number to schedule a service appointment for my wife's 2016 Jetta and I saw the attractive pricing on the Limited Edition trim with a bunch of features I wanted for the same price I paid for my TDI S last summer.  Having owned the Golf TSI, I knew the type of economy I could get from the 1.8t as well as how that engine was to drive (super smooth and responsive around town).  I asked the dealer if they were interested in a TDI trade in and they were, because the inventory has dried up on that front.  I found a 2016 GSW in silk blue and the rest is history.  Overall, the car is fantastic.  I added an aftermarket compact sub/amp, and the sound is great.  I'm averaging 32 mpg per fill up.  Highway economy is slightly better than EPA at around 36 to 38 depending.  I do miss the range of the diesel and the slight fuel savings, and I'm not opposed to having one again.  The TDI ruled highway cruising, but that is maybe 25% of my mileage.  The TSI to me is superior in every other way.  I enjoy having fully independent rear suspension in the TSI as well as the broader torque curve and higher horsepower.  The TSI is a joy to drive and light on it's feet.  I don't think there's a better value in the compact segment than the VW Golf and it's wagon or sport tuned (GTI) variants.After having all the creature comforts in the LE, the one feature that trumps all 2nd only to the rear-view camera is APPLE CARPLAY, IMO.

Negative:  Gas mileage - I am averaging around 22 MPG combined city/hi way driving-that's terrible for a 4-cylinder car!  The only time I can get around 25 MPG is when I drive long distance on the freeway.  Reliability - My transmission needed a major repair at around 36,000 miles (would not go to reverse), lucky for me, it was still under warranty.  Carbon build-up is also a major concern.  At around 57,000 miles, I got a 'check engine' light and then the car stalled.  Had it towed to a dealer and the prognosis was excessive carbon build up in the intakes and failed fuel pump.

The vehicle is white on the exterior with a black interior. The white, even though it's called 'pure white', has a hint of gray hues.  The steering wheel has access to multiple features, such as: MPGs, average MPH for two drivers, audio/stereo controllers, etc. The navigation screen is somewhat small, but the back-up camera is quick to respond and works well at night (due to the back up light illumination).  The problems I've had with this car:-below 74 degrees Fahrenheit, the dual climate simply blows cold. I took it in for diagnoses, but since this occurs while driving; it was unable to be replicated.-the frame around the climate controls on the center-console, has cracked due to fluctuations in temperature. there are cracks around the temperature that could not have been caused by use; rather it is a defect in manufacturing.-the volume controller on the stereo, on the center console, has cracked in half for an unknown reason. There are no stress marks on the plastic, but I believe it was associated with the plastic material they have used throughout. -The 'chrome' frame around the shifter has also cracked without any pressure; again, due to the materials they have used.-Steering wheel: the volume controller on the steering wheel occasionally changes the stereo channel.  Unfortunately, this only happens about once a week, and I'm unable to take it to the dealer at that exact moment. They have been unable to diagnose the problem.I have contacted Volkswagen, but since this is aesthetics  issue; they have been extremely difficult to work with.Now, the car performance: the car runs great. However, this is the first diesel I have owned, and perhaps the last (due to the recall notice).  The car seems to almost shut down at intersections, but that may be due to the computer patch upgrade they made in May causing more combustions for the exhaust removal (part of a recall prior to the EPA making their discoveries public). The acceleration is extremely poor with select performance, even when the vehicle has been warmed up for a minimum of 10 minutes in 60 degree weather. -The trunk doesn't align correctly, so closing it requires that you close it immediately over the back 'VW' emblem for it to latch.  If you are off, it bounces out of place and makes an awful noise.-The Car App to show how your car is performing is a complete JOKE. It takes several minutes to establish a connection, and oftentimes it doesn't pinpoint where your vehicle is at.  In fact, I often get a map of the U.S without an identifier of where my vehicle is stationed. Additionally, it crashes frequently and locking the car can take an average of 15 minutes--- If you are sold by this feature, think again. It is absolutely awful. -The Car Net service that enables you to talk to someone is absolutely awful as well. It cost about $20/month, but the connection takes several minutes.  I spent 15 minutes working to speak with someone twice; needless to say, I haven't contacted them again.  The representatives are outsourced, so when I did speak with them, I had to hear about how the person had no money and their car was broken down. It's definitely not worth it. Items that I like:- you can change the bluetooth connectivity without needing to restart the car; something that my 2013 Jetta SE couldn't do without restarting the car.-the navigation is quite accurate, within feet of speed limit changes and intersections. Unfortunately, you do need to have the audio up on the car to hear it, but I can't seem to circumvent the radio at the same time; even after following the instructions. I imagine if I did get in a car accident, this service would be a complete waste of time as the notification of the airbags being deployed would fall on empty ears.Conclusion:Though VW is attempting to offer more services, similar to American-made cars; they are jumping in without the proper  knowledge in competition with OnStar and digital features as part of their convenience package. The car's performance seems to have been there at some point, but due to recent 'updates' to the emissions; it has caused the performance to decrease.The car itself seems to have been crafted with inferior materials as many of the features are falling apart; some of which have never been used.",2.0,"2015 Jetta TDI SEL Defects I purchased this vehicle brand new in May of 2015.

If you are off, it bounces out of place and makes an awful noise.-The Car App to show how your car is performing is a complete JOKE. It takes several minutes to establish a connection, and oftentimes it doesn't pinpoint where your vehicle is at.  In fact, I often get a map of the U.S without an identifier of where my vehicle is stationed. Additionally, it crashes frequently and locking the car can take an average of 15 minutes--- If you are sold by this feature, think again. It is absolutely awful. -The Car Net service that enables you to talk to someone is absolutely awful as well. It cost about $20/month, but the connection takes several minutes.  I spent 15 minutes working to speak with someone twice; needless to say, I haven't contacted them again.  The representatives are outsourced, so when I did speak with them, I had to hear about how the person had no money and their car was broken down. It's definitely not worth it. Items that I like:- you can change the bluetooth connectivity without needing to restart the car; something that my 2013 Jetta SE couldn't do without restarting the car.-the navigation is quite accurate, within feet of speed limit changes and intersections. Unfortunately, you do need to have the audio up on the car to hear it, but I can't seem to circumvent the radio at the same time; even after following the instructions. I imagine if I did get in a car accident, this service would be a complete waste of time as the notification of the airbags being deployed would fall on empty ears.Conclusion:Though VW is attempting to offer more services, similar to American-made cars; they are jumping in without the proper  knowledge in competition with OnStar and digital features as part of their convenience package. The car's performance seems to have been there at some point, but due to recent 'updates' to the emissions; it has caused the performance to decrease.The car itself seems to have been crafted with inferior materials as many of the features are falling apart; some of which have never been used.","[('t cracks', 'cracks'), ('T marks', 'marks'), ('stress marks', 'marks')]","['awful noise', 'align correctly', 'first diesel', 'close immediately']","[['vehicle', 'new'], ['nt', 'vehicle'], ['nt'], ['audi', 'drive', 'nt', 'etc'], ['work'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'now'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'take'], ['nt', 'work'], ['car', 'great'], ['nt', 'car'], ['vehicle', 'minute'], ['car'], ['nt', 'vehicle', 'minute', 'take'], ['nt', 'vehicle', 'one'], ['nt', 'minute', 'car', 'think', 'take'], ['one'], ['nt', 'minute', 'take'], ['nt', 'minute', 'work', 'one'], ['nt', 'car', 'one'], ['like', 'car'], ['nt'], ['audi', 'nt', 'car'], ['nt', 'car'], ['car', 'now', 'conv'], ['nt', 'car'], ['car']]","[('SEL Defects', 'Defects'), ('vehicle brand', 'brand'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('wheel access', 'access'), ('stereo controllers', 'controllers'), ('navigation screen', 'screen'), ('center console', 'console'), ('volume controller', 'controller'), ('center console', 'console'), ('Steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('volume controller', 'controller'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('stereo channel', 'channel'), ('aesthetics issue', 'issue'), ('car performance', 'performance'), ('computer patch', 'patch'), ('exhaust removal', 'removal'), ('degree weather', 'weather'), ('Net service', 'service'), ('speed limit', 'limit'), ('limit changes', 'changes'), ('car accident', 'accident'), ('convenience package', 'package')]","['never used', 'quick to respond', 'proper knowledge', 'dual climate', 'Now runs', 'falling apart', 'speak twice', 'Unfortunately happens', 'unknown reason', 'inferior materials', 'almost shut', 'unable to take', 'gray hues', 'difficult to work', 'bluetooth connectivity', 'recent updates', 'even called', 'simply blows', 'Unfortunately need', 'select car performance', 'same time', 'exact moment', 'only happens', 'crashes frequently', 'black interior', 'complete waste', 'several minutes', 'more combustions', 'think again', 'multiple features', 'Additionally crashes', 'white hint', 'complete JOKE', 'occasionally limit changes', 'empty ears', 'light illumination', 'contacted again', 'works well', 'more Net services']",neg

Biggest complaint is the transmission is not smooth at all. Can be a little jumpy. Kinda weird that the sticker price for this car was $26k (I didn't pay that though) and it doesn't have auto headlights, climate control A/C and auto seats . It has heated seats, but not auto seats. Weird to me.  Front buckets seats are OK, but back seat is awesome. Lots of legroom for a small car. The leatherette is OK but can get a little swampy on really hot days. Averaging 30 miles to the gallon right now, which is OK. I do mostly freeway driving with surface street driving on weekends, but I do have a bit of a lead foot to be honest. Acceleration is pretty good and much better than other small cars I have driven, then again with the TSI that should be expected. It's pretty fun to drive, but probably more a young person's car than a family car. I guess I'm a young 44 because I think it's fun, though I do prefer the interior room and comfort of my Volvo S60. Instrumentation and touch screen entertainment/nav system is pretty user friendly after a very small learning curve.  I am not a fan of the shiny chrome/black interior look but that is very typical of sporty cars nowadays. Navigation doesn't come with real time traffic so I am not really using it much. Love the blind side monitor on mirrors--very useful and makes me feel safer. Love the remoteless entry, exit and push start. I never use my keys and remote now and I love that.

Despite it's tiny 115hp, it is a blast to drive thanks to the manual transmission, great steering and fun ride. I have owned my Jetta for three years now, and have had very few issues. I live in Wisconsin, and this car surprised the hell out of my friends who had trucks and SUVs by its' performance in heavy snow and ice. For some reason, it is unstoppable in winter weather. I am also 6ft 1 and have plenty of head and legroom while driving. I am disappointed with the gas mileage, I usually average 26 mpg combined, but have gotten 31-32 mpg on long highway trips. The biggest downside with this powertrain is undoubtedly the engine. I frequently have difficulty passing or I have to downshift 2 gears to make it up a small hill. I wouldn't mind if the return was excellent mileage but the mileage as I mentioned is somewhat mediocre for a car of this size. My only truly negative experience was an EPC censor that would put my car in limp mode. The censor randomly would go off when I would start it, and acceleration was limited and the car would max out at 50mph. I took it to several mechanics and a dealer and eventually found out that a botched repair from a previous owner was to blame. Just be careful with these cars though, as the electronics are really touchy and can be expensive to fix.Other than that, I love my car and have had no other mechanical issues to speak of.

I bought the car in Stratford CT. This was a bad idea. At first they let me leave the lot w/ a damaged paint job(that had some awful touch up job that looked noticeable.) I paid in full the car and expected more so naturally, I yelled at the guy who sold me the car. Essentially he didn't do anything for me but his job(swap the car for a perfect vehicle). The next car I just took frustrated, I looked it over briefly, no damages and drove off w/ a different color combo so I didn't need to return to pick up an exact swap....No apologies from the dealership, not a freebie or anything.  The car had 22 miles on it and the steering wheel was actually off center. The alignment didn't feel out. I called them once I was home and told them they would get no further anything from me. I got my servicing local to my house in LI  NY. This dealership made up for all earlier bad experiences. They gave top notch timely service on time every time and I paid nothing as the warranty provides. They were helpful in changing my phone info on the car system as I switched phones. The check engine light went off at 50,000 miles. Turns out to be secondary mass air flow sensor. The mechanic explained that fixing it was optional and chances were the car could continue driving just fine as it was. He was and is right. The repair couldn't be very expensive and it isn't essential. I've gone about 10,000 miles since and no breakdown or malfunctioning w/ the car at just over 60,000 miles now. Everything still works....The car still starts up like it did when new.... ....If you switch climates your leatherette seats will crack and tear .

I paid in full the car and expected more so naturally, I yelled at the guy who sold me the car. Essentially he didn't do anything for me but his job(swap the car for a perfect vehicle). The next car I just took frustrated, I looked it over briefly, no damages and drove off w/ a different color combo so I didn't need to return to pick up an exact swap....No apologies from the dealership, not a freebie or anything.  The car had 22 miles on it and the steering wheel was actually off center. The alignment didn't feel out. I called them once I was home and told them they would get no further anything from me. I got my servicing local to my house in LI  NY. This dealership made up for all earlier bad experiences. They gave top notch timely service on time every time and I paid nothing as the warranty provides. They were helpful in changing my phone info on the car system as I switched phones. The check engine light went off at 50,000 miles. Turns out to be secondary mass air flow sensor. The mechanic explained that fixing it was optional and chances were the car could continue driving just fine as it was. He was and is right.

Beyond this the car is a blast to drive, looks great and gets about 28-30 MPG on the hwy. and 23-25 MPG city. I think VW could have done a bit more with quality control. It's a shame that so many people gave this car a poor review based on apparently simple problems. I for one would buy  VW again.

Important:  If you're living in the mountains you should avoid this trim and opt for a turbocharged engine.  At only 5,000 feet your power output will be less than 98 horsepower.  Go up to 8,000' and you're at 88 horsepower.  I drove the car from sea level to the top of Pike's Peak (14,100') and at max altitude the engine is bogged down to a MAXIMUM of 67 horsepower.  That's at its peak mind you.  You're not going to be happy if you live in the mountains, I can guarantee it.  No matter, at lower elevations it is bearable but you still do a lot of downshifting when there's an incline.  You do get used to it after awhile to a degree.  Put 2-4 passengers in the car and/or a trunk full of items and it does tend to become a snail with wheels though.  Also, when the car is fully loaded there is absolutely no pep or overtaking power to speak of.

Steering is responsive and easy, the vehicle handles satisfactorily in all weather and conditions.  The ride is of good quality.

No frills, but there is an AUX port which is nice.  Dash is hard plastic.  The shifter and gauge cluster/steering wheel is attractive and tidy looking.  The gauges are photosensitive during day driving and will dim/lighten up based on the ambient light in the car.  The trunk is big for a small sedan.  Folding rear seats too.  12v plug in the back seat.  Car has MPG,  Ext.

The combined cost of warranty and non-warranty (my cost) work has surely exceeded the purchase price of the vehicle in 150K miles. It spent much of the Summer 2015 in the dealer shop and they finally admitted they can't fix the emissions system.  Problems started around 10K miles when VW replaced a $7000 part in the exhaust system - that's crazy. Then the problems just went on - 3 times the cruise control failed; several sensors and relays have failed; wiring too close to exhaust parts has burned; the particulate filter clogged; the starter failed; the waste gate has been freed up at least 3 times; the radio failed; the ECM failed; and the turbo actuator and a sensor have failed. This is my 11th and last VW. I finally sold it for parts one week after the recall was announced. The dealer told me to sell it because it could not be fixed. After a year, the person I sold it to has resold it to someone in CT and has made ~$4000 extra from the VW buyback. This Jetta was a lemon and VW Corp treated me like the problem and did nothing to make it right. In retrospect, I suspect the initial replacement part at 10K miles which  involved completely removing the entire front of the vehicle and wiring probably resulted in its being reassembled incorrectly. BTW, the dealer completely rewired the engine compartment at their cost around 150K miles and told me everything was fixed as they had several times before - the IP lights were all on again the next day as they were every time it was ""fixed"". I think my dealer tried to some extent but eventually just wanted me to go away. They knew resetting the ECM would turn off the IP lights for~50 miles so I would go away ""happy"" but be back in a couple of days.What is even worse than the vehicle is the way VW has told me it's not their problem that my vehicle sucks.

So far, I'm very satisfied with it. One issue would be with the engine -- my previous car was a Toyota Corolla and its 2.0L engine seemed to have much more zip than this Jetta, especially going up hills. This Jetta is a manual shift and it is very smooth going from one gear to another and now that I have a new set of tires on it, my gas mileage is much better, in the 33-36 mpg range, rather than 29-31 mpg with my old tires. The interior is appointed nicely -- the controls are easy to read and accessible while driving. There are lots of options for seat adjustment, in both the nearness to the steering wheel but also seat height. Since I'm an audiophile, the sound system is important to me and it doesn't disappoint. Those controls are also easy to navigate and program. Another thing I'd suggest is for Volkswagen to include a couple USB ports on the lower trim models. Right now, I have an external port plugged into my cigarette lighter (not a problem since I'm a non-smoker), but even it seems to integrate well with the sound system. This car is a daily driver for me, but occasionally, I have passengers and they have all commented on the roominess not only in the passenger seat, but in the rear seats. The last suggestion I'd have is that there should be a daytime/nighttime function on the driver's side and passenger side mirrors to alleviate glare on all the trim models.

 on 07/25/15 15:23 PM (PDT),Marty ,2012 Volkswagen Golf Diesel 2.0L TDI 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl Turbodiesel 6AM),Love/Hate TDI relationship," After owning this Golf TDI car for only one month, here is what I think so far:PROs:- Gas Mileage:  I average 36 mpg.  Plus, diesel is 30 cents/gallon cheaper than 87 octane gas in California.- Front Seats:  The heavy bolstering holds me in place during aggressive cornering.  Larger individuals may hate it.  The cloth material is thick, durable, and textured for additional grip.- Interior: the soft touch dash and leather steering wheel make the interior feel a bit upscale. - Tire Pressure Sensor:  I had 2 defective tires, both of which went flat.  They were not noticeable without the sensor.- Steering:  The steering ratio is a little aggressive with medium effort to steer.  It adds to a sporty feel. - Suspension:  Good compromise of firmness and compliance over bumps.  It feels sporty, but is still useful as a daily driver. - Diesel power:  This engine won't wow anyone with straight line acceleration.  It does extremely well at low RPMs where all the torque is made.  Climbing hilly roads feels effortless for the vehicle.  Diesel engines also have a record of being very reliable.  We will see if that holds true in this car. - Sound/infotainment system:  The sound quality is above average for a non-premium system.  It comes stock with a 6 disc changer, which is useful if you want to dust off your old CD collection.  The infotainment system does not take long to learn.  Also, the radio can turn on with no key in the ignition.  That is convenient for entertaining children/passengers, if you don't trust them alone with the keys in the car. CONs:- Diesel Availability:  Diesel fuel is not always easy to find when you are looking.  About 1 in 3 gas stations in my area have it. - DSG:  This transmission is probably the worst transmission I've ever used.  Have you ever been stopped, push the throttle and not go anywhere for 1-2 seconds.  The car will inch forward for another second, and then react appropriately to your input.  This is dangerous when making a left hand turn in front of oncoming traffic.  It only happens about 25% of the time, so it is completely unpredictable and happens in both standard drive mode and sport mode.  Similar delays happen when trying to pass, but I'm used to cars getting confused about downshifting.  There is no downshifting from a stop, at least I hope not.  Engine braking is weird as well.  It is most noticeable when coasting to a stop.  The DSG engages 1st gear at about 12-13mph, decelerating the car quickly to 6-7mph, then coasting again.  When coasting from high speeds to low speeds, such as coasting to 35mph from 55mph, the engine revs to 3100 RPM in preparation for a downshift.  The diesel engine free reving at 3100 RPMs is loud.  This has lasted up to 20 seconds until it finally downshifts to induce engine braking.  It's odd to experience this from the driver's seat. - Engine Noise:  The engine sounds like a gasoline engine with valve knocking.  It turns heads in a parking lot and not in a good way.  However, once at cruising speeds the noise is no longer intrusive in the cabin.- Doors:  The door settles into positions to hold itself open for getting in/out.  The first position is just wide enough to squeeze out of the car.  The second position threatens neighboring cars in many parking situations, and hits the wall in my garage.  There is no easy in-between because the door pushes/pulls its way to one of those positions.  It's a weird nuisance I rarely needed to think about with other cars. - Bluetooth:  Set to interrupt music with navigation updates from my phone, it also cuts off my music every two minutes for a voicemail recording that doesn't exist on my phone. - Blind spots:  The massive B-pillar is in my way for checking blind spots.  My seating position plays a part. I am 6' 2"" tall. - Phone charging:  I'm using the same USB adapter from my old car to charge my phone and it charges noticeably slower.  - Locking system:  The car honks when you lock the car with the key fob.  I asked the dealership to disable that honk, and they said they can't on this particular model.  Additionally, the lock button in the car door only works when all the doors are closed, so you cannot use it to lock your car as you exit the vehicle.  I'm stuck annoying sleeping neighbors when I come home at night. Additional conveniences I think this car should have:- Automatic headlights - this has been in some cars for decades, why is it not a feature in all cars. - Automatic climate control - Put in a temperature and forget. Same logic as above, all cars should have this by now. Conclusion:Overall, I think the car is a compromise.  I really enjoy the gas mileage, interior quality, and sporty upgrades, but I really hate the DSG and engine noise.  The price premium eats most of the gas savings over a regular Golf.  If you really want a TDI and are comfortable with a manual transmission, I highly recommend going that route.",4.0,"Love/Hate TDI relationship After owning this Golf TDI car for only one month, here is what I think so far:PROs:- Gas Mileage:  I average 36 mpg.

Also, the radio can turn on with no key in the ignition.  That is convenient for entertaining children/passengers, if you don't trust them alone with the keys in the car. CONs:- Diesel Availability:  Diesel fuel is not always easy to find when you are looking.  About 1 in 3 gas stations in my area have it. - DSG:  This transmission is probably the worst transmission I've ever used.  Have you ever been stopped, push the throttle and not go anywhere for 1-2 seconds.  The car will inch forward for another second, and then react appropriately to your input.  This is dangerous when making a left hand turn in front of oncoming traffic.  It only happens about 25% of the time, so it is completely unpredictable and happens in both standard drive mode and sport mode.  Similar delays happen when trying to pass, but I'm used to cars getting confused about downshifting.  There is no downshifting from a stop, at least I hope not.  Engine braking is weird as well.  It is most noticeable when coasting to a stop.  The DSG engages 1st gear at about 12-13mph, decelerating the car quickly to 6-7mph, then coasting again.  When coasting from high speeds to low speeds, such as coasting to 35mph from 55mph, the engine revs to 3100 RPM in preparation for a downshift.  The diesel engine free reving at 3100 RPMs is loud.  This has lasted up to 20 seconds until it finally downshifts to induce engine braking.  It's odd to experience this from the driver's seat. - Engine Noise:  The engine sounds like a gasoline engine with valve knocking.  It turns heads in a parking lot and not in a good way.  However, once at cruising speeds the noise is no longer intrusive in the cabin.- Doors:  The door settles into positions to hold itself open for getting in/out.  The first position is just wide enough to squeeze out of the car.  The second position threatens neighboring cars in many parking situations, and hits the wall in my garage.  There is no easy in-between because the door pushes/pulls its way to one of those positions.  It's a weird nuisance I rarely needed to think about with other cars. - Bluetooth:  Set to interrupt music with navigation updates from my phone, it also cuts off my music every two minutes for a voicemail recording that doesn't exist on my phone. - Blind spots:  The massive B-pillar is in my way for checking blind spots.  My seating position plays a part. I am 6' 2"" tall. - Phone charging:  I'm using the same USB adapter from my old car to charge my phone and it charges noticeably slower.  - Locking system:  The car honks when you lock the car with the key fob.  I asked the dealership to disable that honk, and they said they can't on this particular model.  Additionally, the lock button in the car door only works when all the doors are closed, so you cannot use it to lock your car as you exit the vehicle.  I'm stuck annoying sleeping neighbors when I come home at night. Additional conveniences I think this car should have:- Automatic headlights - this has been in some cars for decades, why is it not a feature in all cars. - Automatic climate control - Put in a temperature and forget. Same logic as above, all cars should have this by now. Conclusion:Overall, I think the car is a compromise.  I really enjoy the gas mileage, interior quality, and sporty upgrades, but I really hate the DSG and engine noise.  The price premium eats most of the gas savings over a regular Golf.  If you really want a TDI and are comfortable with a manual transmission, I highly recommend going that route.","[('cloth material', 'material'), ('steering ratio', 'ratio'), ('Diesel engines', 'engines'), ('Diesel fuel', 'fuel'), ('gas stations', 'stations'), ('Engine braking', 'braking'), ('engine revs', 'revs'), ('diesel engine', 'engine'), ('B pillar', 'pillar'), ('price premium', 'premium'), ('gas savings', 'savings')]","['massive B pillar', 'Good compromise', 'medium effort', 'Blind spots', 'ever used', 'additional grip', 'low speeds', 'regular Golf', 'Also turn', 'high speeds', 'Larger individuals', 'particular model', 'blind spots', 'worst transmission', 'low RPMs']","[['nt', 'car', 'think', 'one'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['sport'], ['drive', 'sport'], ['one'], ['vehicle', 'road'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'come'], ['nt', 'take'], ['nt', 'car', 'one', 'conv', 'child'], ['second'], ['car', 'second'], ['nt'], ['drive', 'sport'], ['car'], ['car'], ['nt', 'second'], ['drive'], ['like'], ['good'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['car'], ['car', 'second'], ['one'], ['car', 'think'], ['nt', 'minute', 'one'], ['car', 'one'], ['car'], ['vehicle', 'car', 'work'], ['come', 'home'], ['car', 'think', 'conv'], ['nt'], ['car', 'now'], ['car', 'think'], ['nt', 'sport'], ['nt']]","[('Love relationship', 'relationship'), ('Hate relationship', 'relationship'), ('TDI relationship', 'relationship'), ('TDI car', 'car'), ('octane gas', 'gas'), ('Front Seats', 'Seats'), ('leather steering', 'steering'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('Pressure Sensor', 'Sensor'), ('Diesel power', 'power'), ('line acceleration', 'acceleration'), ('premium system', 'system'), ('disc changer', 'changer'), ('CD collection', 'collection'), ('hand turn', 'turn'), ('engine braking', 'braking'), ('gasoline engine', 'engine'), ('parking lot', 'lot'), ('neighboring cars', 'cars'), ('parking situations', 'situations'), ('navigation updates', 'updates'), ('voicemail recording', 'recording'), ('Phone charging', 'charging'), ('USB adapter', 'adapter'), ('lock button', 'button'), ('car door', 'door'), ('sleeping neighbors', 'neighbors'), ('climate control', 'control'), ('gas mileage', 'mileage')]","['inch forward', 'decelerating quickly', 'heavy bolstering', 'defective tires', 'Overall think', 'Additional conveniences', 'manual transmission', 'highly recommend', 'second position', 'Automatic headlights', 'really enjoy', 'take long', 'straight line acceleration', 'standard mode', 'old CD collection', 'good way', 'annoying sleeping neighbors', 'coasting again', 'Automatic climate control', 'left hand', 'soft touch', 'daily driver', 'infotainment premium system', 'hilly roads', 'only happens', '1st gear', 'rarely needed', 'Same logic', 'same USB adapter', 'think far', 'Additionally works', 'aggressive cornering', 'wide to squeeze', 'sound quality', 'really hate', 'decelerating then', 'react appropriately', 'non premium system', 'key fob', 'many parking situations', 'really want', 'other TDI neighboring cars', 'Similar delays', 'then react', 'come home', 'weird nuisance', 'first position', 'sporty upgrades', 'finally downshifts', 'interior quality', 'old TDI car', 'oncoming traffic', 'ever stopped', 'only works']",neg

This 2014 Beetle was my 3rd Beetle since obtaining a license at 17 years old in 2007. I was obsessed with the car! It was a great color and loved the acceleration compared to my 2005 Beetle with only 115HP. I have driven so much in the last 2.5 years of owning it! I have racked up 70,000 miles in just 2.5 years! Yes thats a lot and I haven't had any major repairs yet! Although i'm getting nervous for the water pump/ timing belt replacement that comes between 80-100k miles and the dealerships charge about $1k. Besides that I  only take my car to my local VW dealerships for oil changes. The only problem I've had with my car are the breaks. Even when I had my car for a few months they started to squeak when I would slow down. Especially during cold temperatures! Sometimes it gets very loud and my passengers are like wow you need new breaks already? I did take it into the dealership and they said they would have to send a request for them to replace it for free since it was still under the warranty. weeks went by and i never received a phone call. and summer rolled around so it made less noise and it didn't bother me. Before I knew it I was over the mileage for the warranty. Hopefully when i replace my brakes sometime this year the noise will stop. Another problem is my passenger seat sucks! I'm assuming it broke somehow. When someone wants to get in the back seat i pull the seat forward but when i push it back, it goes ALL the way back and the upper part of the seat does not come forward like it should. I have to aggressively pull the seat back with all my force and my passengers are again shocked! Another interesting tidbit is i am a 215 lb male and i noticed either of the front seats if you are heavy, and tend to move or when you make a turn, the seats will squeak! Its' kinda embarrasing if my friends are in the car. Also, I think my speakers really suck! I mean i know i don't expect the base speakers to sound like Fender, but I was in my friends 2011 Jetta and his speakers sounded way better than miles. I was surprised considering mines a 2014. The Beetle that I got happened to be one of the last 2.5L 5-cyl engines made.. a few months later they rolled out with the 1.8L's. Like I said I haven't had any major repairs or been stranded. I know I am getting close to 100k miles and i just get very nervous thinking about what i may need to replace. and since i am a student and work part time in California, money plays a factor. One thing i also don't like are the seats, they are in a way uncomfortable especially on road trips. I am 6'2"" and i will get back pain. It feels like i am sitting on top of something. I don't really like it. The gas mileage is not too bad and not too good. I feel like this car shouldn't be your everyday car. But its mine. Its definitely fun to drive. I really wanted the turbo 2.0L r-line but i can't afford the higher gas grade or any major repairs in the future especially since its a turbo. One thing i did notice is that since 2010ish, VW has downgraded their interior quality by using cheap materials which makes it sad. One thing about the newer Beetle is that we all know its retro design, but when you're actually driving and holding onto the steering wheel at the 10 and 2 marks it really does feel like you're almost driving the older ones. not sure how to explain it but it may have to do with the steering wheel design/structure.",4.0,"Retro design with minor flaws I've always been a Beetle fanatic since they came out with the second generation in 1998 when I was 8 years old!

But to my surprise, this has been the most reliable car I've ever owned.  Change the oil, and the car is like brand-new again.  I think that folks have issues VW's because unlike Japanese cars, you really should stick to the maintenance schedules otherwise I can imagine you have a lot of problems.  This engine for example, eats oil so you really shouldn't go over the recommended oil change intervals.  Having owned this car for almost 8 years now I can say that I've only had a few things go wrong with it, there was an issue VW fixed under and extended warranty for a particular part.  The 90K service was the only thing I ever paid for it, but that was the only major maintenance I have ever done on this car so far.  It was about $2K for that services.  $2K in maintenance over almost 8 years is not bad at all... This really is the perfect everyday car for young people or retirees without kids or for kids who have left the nest.  The best thing about this car is that it is quick and responsive.  The clutch travel is short and the torque means you have instant responses to input which means you can get out of tight situations in traffic, pass with ease, squeeze through cars and obstacles, take tight turns with stability and confidence, and you have enough space to carry pretty much anything in the trunk and more if you fold the seats down.  The ride is rigid for sure, but refined in the same way.  It's very comfortable at highway speeds, but the car seems to get a bit more frazzled as you approach the top speed the more and more you go above 115 mph or so.  What I love most about this car however is that it thinks about practical things about the driver of the car and has little nuances I've never seen in American cars or Japanese luxury cars.  It, for example, will automatically engage the rear window wiper when your front wipers are on and you go into reverse.  This is so you can see behind you (very thoughtful).  It also allows you to lock the car with the remote  before closing the door so you can get your groceries out and close the door without worry about engaging the lock button with your hands full.  Besides that it's got a great stereo and great xenon lights.  It's such an awesome and well thought out car!The weaknesses of this car largely have to do with it's size.  Because it's light, small, and quick, it's not terribly great at being a car for all seasons and not my ideal car for the long road trip (especially if you have 1 or more passengers).  The cabin space can feel cramped after a while and with me being 6'1"" I can't ever get the seat low enough without seeming to stare through the top part of the windshield.  Large puddles have a way or really slowing this car down and it's not that great on snow.  The major weakness of this car though I would have to say is the air conditioning.  On really really hot days, 90+ degree heat with 90+% humidity in the D.C. area, it never seemed to get nearly as cool as you would want it.  I guess it never gets that hot in Germany... who knows?  But on days like that I always wish the air conditioner was better.  The heating however is immaculate, with the window open on days of 50 degrees or less, it radiates heat automatically so you never feel cold.Having kids soon with more storage needs I kind of wish this car would start having problems, so I can have an excuse to get a larger car, but so far, it hasn't happened.

I recommend the '02 and up GTIs (30 more HP). All the rumors about the electric and use of cheap parts are true. The sunroof drainage tubes are cheap rubber hoses that will leak on you. The power windows will go out on you. The cheaper stock turbo hoses will leak or bust.

I use it for daily driving and I am really surprised about the all around capabilities of this car. As you can see by the mileage I am a pretty daily commuter and with 3 1/2 months I have put 10k miles on my little Fun Box. Plain and simple, this is an Audi in so many ways. Overall I have had nothing, but great things to say about  this car. This car will not Wow you at first. It drives very nice and is compliant for everyday use. The moment you find the Race Mode along with a heavier foot.... and then you will simply say out loud..... ""Holy Sh...."". It does not initially seem fast at the top half of the soft pedal. This really is an awesome vehicle after you get to know that this is not a Boy Toy, but rather a very nicely balanced Stealth Fighter.I should mention that I have a 5 year old and and a 7 year old and they both ride comfortably in the back. I would also say that I have had adults up to 5' 9"" that fit OK in the back seats. Keep in mind that I am over 6' and adjusted my seat forward for adults.I only have a very short list about what I would improve for simply my personal taste. Don't get me wrong, this car is really great in so many ways.                       1. I am 6"" 2"" and 225 lbs..... I do at times feel a little tight in the seats after about an hour. Just returned from a round trip of 1300 miles and did just fine. Maybe just time to start doing some sit ups. 2. Replaced 3 of 4 - 19"" wheels along with one tire due to bends from local Northeast US Potholes. Trust me- Buy the Road Hazard Warranty- I paid $900 and already received a receipt for $2600 in parts and Labor that I did not have to layout. The ride is not bad, but the bumps around here make for a very cautious ride. Swapping for 18"" wheels this winter.3. VW needs to wake up with this entertainment head unit.

 on 06/03/16 21:43 PM (PDT),MidCow3 ,2016 Volkswagen Golf R Hatchback w/Dynamic Chassis Control and Navigation 4dr Hatchback AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),"Golf R, Long Term also bought FordRS. more fun"," This review has been updated after owning the Golf R a little over 1 year.I  drove a 6 speed manual Ford Focus ST, ST3 and moon roof for 3 1/2 years.I was going to get the Ford Focus RS with AWD and 350 Hp; I ended up getting a lE Ford Focus RS RS in January 2018; still have Golf R The color selection on the RS was limited to grey,white,black, and nitrous blue).   I knew that the interior of the VW was better, but I didn't know how much better until I actually bought the Golf R and had some seat time with it.  The ride of the Ford Focus ST was pretty stiff and the RS was going to be 33% stiffer on the comfort setting; I wasn't looking forward to a rougher ride.  The ride on the Golf R with the DCC mode set in comfort mode is very smooth and compliant. I was right on this one some late Ford RS reviews compare the Ford RS ride to a pogo stick or a bucking bronc on anything but very smooth roads. Actual Ford RS ride isn't thta badOkay , I bought the 2016 Golf R with Manual 6-speed transmission, DCC with Nav, and the Driver's Assistance Package.  With DCC (Dynamic Chassis Control) there is a dramatic difference between the settings. I like the individual settings with most everything set on normal or comfort except for the sport exhaust sound. I like this setting because the Golf R remembers it between stops and starts and you don't have to always reselect it every time you start. I found the interior , especially how the devices function at night to be a lot nicer with better feel and better night lighting. The interior is much higher level than first look, the back seats have 2 inches more room, the gas tank is 14.5 gallons compared to 12.4 in the ST and 13.9 in the RS. The mileage is great 22/31 rated , compared to ST 23/32 and RS 19/25.  Long term, even with sporty driving, I get around 26 miles overall which makes for a very nice driving range.The rear seat passenger leg room is 35.4 Inches which is 2.2 inches more than the RS and ST and allows a 6 ft passenger to comfortably ride behind a 6 ft driver. The Golf R can travel 4 adults for long distances in comfort.Another nice feature in the Golf R is that the seats actually fold fairly flat. In the ST there is a 4 inch drop and they don't actually fold flat.  RS don't fold flat eaither but stiull fold enough tonNow one of the best features is the Driver's Assistance Package which includes several higher level safety items: (1) the ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control), (2) lane keep assist,(3) are front and rear proximity sensors that help you when you are parking or backing with visual and audio warnings of objects in your path, and (4) and probably the best is blind spot monitoring, a yellow blind spot light flashes in you left or right mirror if a vehicle is in your blind spot area. (5) autonomous emergency braking if the front sensors detects an impending collision it brakes for you, and (6) rear traffic alert alerts you to cars coming up fast in the rear of your left or right; this works extremely well. Oh now let's talk about the turbo, since the power comes on at a very low 1,800 RPM and the boost is fairly linear you don't notice any turbo lag and it almost feels non-turbo like until you look at the speedometer and you are rapidly increasing your speed. The power is great, you have a lot of power in sixth and most of the time unless you don't need to downshift to pass . Same with the Ford RS, but much more.  Both the Golf r and Ford RS havce amplified, some call fake motor noises, I am okay with that ...but some aren't and it can easily be turnd off( i.e. disabled) in both cars.In summary, the is a very fast, very fun car, that has high level accoutrements, and gets good gas mileage, with very comfortable seats and easy drivability.  Also a lot of things are automatic; auto lights(early, normal, late), driving mode, rain sensing wipers, radar detector automatically starts, gas door automatically unlocks and no start-stop to disable.  But in all honesty, the Ford Focus RS is more fun and I drive it mostly.Ford Focus has announced a limited edition 2018 supposedly last year Race Red and I bought one.Modifications: I had the following installed: Diesel Geek Sigma 6 short shifter (very precise shifting ), 50% Luminar Tint, and front bumper and partial front hood PPL protection, Escort Red Line radar detector.I thought the winner was the Golf R when I first bought it, and now I am absolutely sure the Ford Focus RS may be the best choice in a ""hot"" manual shift hatchback even though the Golf R is still much better for trips. The Golf R triumphs in the long-term evaluation!  While maybe not as fast as Focus RS or as ""school-boy gaudy look at me""  or as loud of stock exhaust the Golf R is a far, far better all around car and daily driver. It doesn't have all the rough edges or the rough ride the Ford Focus RS has.

Then noticed issues with assembly fuel mileage and engine noises. VW claims the atlas itâs 18/25 Mpg. We have yet to get more than 11 MPG. I have taken it on short trips on the freeway and have not gotten better than 18 mpg. Dealer claims that itâs normal because I only drive on the city streets. That doesnât make sense. Tell lights arenât lined up, one headlight is off line, or die lined up, liftgate is not in line, hood is not in line, and we had a door panel  armrest that had to be replaced because it came undone. On acceleration we getting noise that sounds like sucking air, dealership says all the vehicles do that. When we turn off the motor it sounds like a fan hitting a metal shroud, dealer again says thatâs normal  and all the vehicles  are the same. We are paying a lot of money for this vehicle and we expected to be assembled properly. Manufacturer has been involved and has no solution to fix things they replace the taillight but itâs in the same spot one taillight has a spacer and is up the other taillight doesnât and is flush.  I pointed out this fact and suggested that they left gate was not installed correctly. The body lines donât lineup and there is a large space between the bumper guard in the liftgate. Nothing was done. First time took it for these issues they put us in a Jetta And how do our Atlas for one week. They had to order tail light and door panel. When they came in they put us in another Jetta for two days. The tail light still is not correct. Call the dealership and manufacture again regarding these issues, and was told to set an appointment at the dealer and they would bring in the technician again.

 on 02/06/14 11:25 AM (PST),cpmariner ,2013 Volkswagen Touareg Diesel TDI Lux 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),Mixed Bag (II)," Overall, this excellent car is very comfortable (plenty of room for a 6' 4"" man), amazingly powerful, highly maneuverable, great fuel economy, and really fun to drive. My wife fell in love with it, and her Lexus 350 GS is rapidly gathering dust in the garage. However, at 3,000 miles I'm beginning to worry about reliability. The first to go was the power seat memory -recently fixed. More serious, though, is an intermittent ""roaring"" noise from under the hood. To me, it seems to be the engine cooling fan running at 100% for no apparent reason. But the dealer's techies are sure that it's power steering-related and requires no ""fix"". Sounds like code for ""we don't know"" to me. We'll see.(Later, after 10,000 miles) Obviously, the thing most on my mind is the resolution of VW's emissions cheat. Apparently settlements are in progress for the 2.0 liter diesel models, but for the 3.0 liters - like mine - the jury's still out. I hate this, because the more I drive the car, the more I like it. But I fear that any ""fix"" VW might come up with will affect performance, mileage, or both. (If not to improve performance/mileage, why else would they have done it?) Likewise, I can't reasonably imagine that any cash compensation will really cover the loss of value, no matter what VW says. In any event, I'd hate to give up the car... unless a ""fix"" results in a poor performance, low mileage Panzer.Otherwise, that roaring noise I previously reported turned out to be exactly what a commenter on my previous review pointed out: a normal and necessary filter cleaning apparatus. I'm just surprised that none of those ""VW Certified"" technicians at the dealership were ignorant of it. Minor electronic glitches persist. The most annoying - although it sometimes makes me laugh when it happens - is that the automatic driver's seat retraction (the seat's supposed to move backward automatically when the engine is shut down and the driver's door opened, to allow for easier exit) sometimes gets ""confused"", and moves forward instead of backward. It's comical, really... like the car is annoyed with me and wants to crush me up against the steering wheel. (It's easily stopped by hitting #1 setting on the pre-set seat positions panel.) I've also come to be less pleased with steering performance. It's not quite as stable as I'd originally thought, particularly during long, sweeping curves at medium speeds. I do have to ""saw"" the steering wheel a little bit during such curves to stay on track. Some have said that the Touareg is a ""Cayenne in drag"", and that's true in many respects. But I recently had occasion to drive a Cayenne, and the better steering performance was noticeable. However, I don't think an extra $5K to $10K for better steering through sweeping curves would be approved by my wallet. In city driving, the Touareg's steering is fine, with an especially tight steering radius for getting in and out of parking spots.(All that said, my wife recently bought a 2016 Mercedes GLC but still ""steals"" my Touareg whenever she can :-)So overall, I still enjoy the Touareg enormously and look forward to driving it. The highway gas mileage is ""as advertised"" (close to 30mpg, as measured) and it's a very, very comfortable vehicle for long distance driving, particularly if you're tall. Occasional back seat passengers often comment about the extra leg room as opposed to the competition. The passenger seat back goes down almost to a sleeping position (almost flat), and that's a bonus for shared long distance driving. All-around visibility is very good. Stability in windy conditions is very good. Pick-up is very, VERY good... particularly helpful for passing, highway entrance ramps, and for a short burst to escape those ""awkward"" high speed traffic situations created by the crazy zoomies we all know about.If I were the ""protestor"" sort, I might put on a sandwich board saying ""Please Don't Take My Touareg Away!"" and march outside the EPA headquarters.",4.0,"Mixed Bag (II) Overall, this excellent car is very comfortable (plenty of room for a 6' 4"" man), amazingly powerful, highly maneuverable, great fuel economy, and really fun to drive.

I lucked out and found a one owner, low mileage 2010 that felt right. I went from a GMC Yukon to the VW and haven't regretted it one bit.

They just didn't have the handling, interior or feel of the VW. I have two parents in their 80's that live with my husband and me and we all fit very comfortably in the VW. My father is tall and has trouble bending his hips/legs but can get in and out of the back seat with no problem. He was never able to get in and out of the rear seat with the Yukon. One thing we noticed in car shopping is the flat floorboard of the VW. There is no foot well (if that's what you call it) so my father was not having to lift his feet up over a lip to get in and out. I have been on two long trips with it over the last six months and it rides and handles beautifully. I put new Parelli tires on it (they are made for the Porsche, Audi and Touareg) and they are really wide and stable. The gas mileage isn't as bad as I expected, average is around 18 in the city. There are a couple things that I am missing and will have on my next Touareg; the auxiliary jack for the stereo and the panoramic sunroof (This one is small).

Brakes squeal constantly & they've already been replaced once (Not covered under warranty). Back seats take forever to fold down.

But, I found the TDI's to be expensive so I've been patient.  I found a Black T-Reg diesel advertised as a Certified Preowned with 63k miles at a local VW Dealer.  The vehicle was in excellent physical condition and all of its meticulous service records were available at the dealer where the only previous owner always had it serviced.  I didn't even dicker on price.  Unfortunately, less than 24 hours after purchase the check engine light and warning graphics came on.  It ended up being an oil sensor that was replaced under warranty.  A week or so later, I noticed the Nav system would blink off inexplicably but would always reboot and come back on.  I needed to take the vehicle back to the dealer to have the right rear window fixed (dropped down and wouldn't go back up).  The service manager told me VW had a service bulletin on the Nav and it required reprogramming to work out the bug.  They did this and fixed the window under the CPO warranty.  That was about a month ago and after a rather auspicious start with this T-Reg, it seems to be operating well.  The only other issue I've had, and it was a one-time thing, is the rear hatch wouldn't open one day either with the power assist or manually.  But after driving it a few miles and trying it again it worked fine.  Weird, but I hope its not a precursor to another failure and trip to the dealer.The things I like most: I'm 6'4"" and the seating position is excellent and I like the front bucket seat comfort much better than in my wife's newer Lexus RX.  The ride around town is harsh but on the highway its a dream.  This vehicle has great acceleration and doesn't suffer major turbo lag like other turbo diesels I've owned.  The gas mileage is reasonable (21-22 around town and about 26 on the highway so far).  The sound system is very good and I've found the Nav system easy to use and decently intuitive for a 6 year old technology.The things I like least:  Slight rattle in dash somewhere at lower speed, but with the radio at normal volume its hardly noticable.  Rear cargo room is very limited and the rear seats don't completely fold flat.  Harshness of ride on bumpy roads around town.  Lacks rear LED tail lights and for a vehicle in its price range when new this should've have been a standard as should have been front seat presets.Overall:  I really like the vehicle and although it is 6 years old by model year and I understand it will have service issues from time to time, I'm hoping the initial quirky gremlins are behind me.

I had a substantial reduction on the price for this marvelous car. I was waiting for the TDI to be available but the negotiation was so convenient that I could not refuse the opportunity. I always had Toyota and Subaru, VW prices were still too high until the problem appears and allow many people to afford the most expensive car that VW was selling. I have the color combination that I want it, the engine is quite powerfull and driving home from the place i bought it it was extremely comfortable and the riding is way better than any Japanese or American cars, it just feel that the car stick to the road the faster you go. In fact I had to really floor the accelerator in 2 opportunities, not to be a showboat a.h. but to pass a line of 18 wheels trucks that was obstructing the road for several miles. The engine really roars and is not only a lot of noise with no action,but a lot of passing power. I had the chance of driving the TDI and this power was more evident. As I mentioned I lost the window and came to the dealer 1 day after the no selling decision was taken nationwide. I have read cons comments about the mpg but if you realize the car is full time AWD and off course this cars will take more gas and even more tire rubber that simpler FWD or RWD. I believe owing this Suv gives you a lot of prestige because you do not see many of them driving around, in your town or the road, the price may be a factor. But thing about this will select also a niche of buyers. Same thing happens with the Land Cruisers from Toyota, you do not see many around because is only for few people able to afford it, still a great truck that is highly valued here and overseas. The off road capability of this car is amazing, besides that the American selling model do not has the posibility to increase or decrease the car hight (which is the advantage of Jeep Cherokee) still give you the advantage of changing roads or climb to higher lands in every day situations like heavy rain, floded roads, muddy FM roads, etc.  The model I got is stronger than a Toyota 4Runner and way more comfortable however we lost some luggage space.

This combination of packages is very difficult to find because of the DAP - - not many of them out there, and I got a pretty good deal on the price from Boucher as well.  As an aside, the dealer was really good to work with - - I flew to Wisconsin from Texas to get the car and the sales rep (Justin Zantow) picked me up at the airport.  They were also very candid and transparent about what they could / could not negotiate with on price, down to showing me their numbers and pushing their own finance people to make the best deal possible.  The car was immaculate when I picked it up and the sales rep took the time to walk me through the features and get the infotainment system set-up with my phone before I drove off the lot.  It's a solid car - well put together and nothing looks cheap or flimsy on it. It's a little beast.I think I've taken advantage of / experienced all of the different facets of the DAP, from lane change warnings, adaptive cruise control, to emergency braking.  Some of these were done intentionally, and others happened when other folks did something stupid on the road.  Bottom line - - the DAP works as advertised and I highly recommend it if you can find a GTI with it.  The Lighting (SEL) package is pretty sweet as well - gives the car a wow factor when you get in or when folks watch you drive by.  I haven't messed too much with the Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) yet - it is only available with the Performance Package, I think - most of the settings are set to ""Sport"" except for the distance on the cruise control - - ""dumb people doing stupid things on the road"" is the best explanation.Probably the only regret is the seats on the SE aren't as adjustable on the Autobahn - - they're not bad, but I'm still getting used to the distance required to hit the clutch properly when shifting.  It wasn't worth the extra money to me to upgrade for just the seats and fancier infotainment system.The other beefs, and they are minor, are - The storage space in the center console is barely big enough to hold a large smartphone like a Note 4 or an iPhone.  You could keep the phone somewhere else and connect to the infotainment system via Bluetooth to make phone calls, but there's only one USB port and you have to be connected to it to use Android Auto, Apple Car Play, or MirrorVision (?)- (1 year update) one other minor complaint about the infotainment system is the wired connection to the phone to use Android Auto (I don't have an iPhone so I can't comment on Car Play).  VW recommends you use the phone manufacturer's cable to connect the phone to the USB slot in the center console.  Not the easiest place to get your hands into connect an USB plug, and any wiggle/connection problem on the mini-SD connection with the phone causes the infotainment system not to recognize the phone, preventing you from using Android Auto.- You can only have one active Bluetooth connection with the infotainment system - - I have an Android phone and an iPod and wanted to use the iPod as a data source for my music.  A second USB port would've done the trick, perhaps, but I think the designers assumed users would have their music on their smartphone (like an iPhone).  The alternatives are to use the AUX connection (basically a dumb line in that you manage from the iPod) or copy your music to an SD card and use one of the two SD card slots in the glove compartment so the infotainment system can read the music from there.Apart from that - the car's (still) a blast, gets great gas mileage and is hella fun to drive even shifting in traffic.

 on 11/06/16 06:42 AM (PST),Steve ,2014 Volkswagen Beetle Convertible Convertible 1.8T 2dr Convertible (1.8L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Surprising!!!," Last summer I decided to live out one of my dreams. My mom has just retired and also shared a similar dream and that was drive up the PCH from LA to Sab Francisco in a convertible. After doing a bunch of research on rental car companies we chose on that we felt would work for our needs. Much to my disappointment upon arrival we were told that there are three cars available for us non of which where un my list of cars to rent or had a big American V8. My choices where a baby blue beetle convertible or a purple Miata. Knowing that we would be spending the next two weeks on the road and where going to have friends in the car with us we chose the Beetle. I was familiar with VW as I had a TDI Jetta at the time so the interior was very familiar. We through both suitcases in the trunk and they both fight surprisingly. I put the top down with ease and programmed the Bluetooth so that I could get some direction on where I was going which took all of 3 minutes. With my destination plugged we head off Oceanside, Ca which is about 90 miles south of LA. Getting in the highway I heard the distinct sound of a turbo whistling and thought to myself that this may not be as bad as I thought. We drove the 90 miles with the top down and the heated seats on and had no problems. We stopped twice on the way down to get some food and water and a bathroom break and each time we stopped there was a comment on the car. My disappointment started to turned around. With the top down, the ocean breezing filling the cabin and the stereo cranked I was really started to enjoy the car. We had no problems hearing the radio with the top down either and I was even able to make a phone call using the Bluetooth and on the other end the person could hear me just fine. After spending several days in Oceanside with some friends and a few dinner runs with four people in the car I was very surprised with how much this convertible could do. The next stop was San Pedro and again we had no issues with the car. Evening sitting in the terrible LA traffic everything seemed perfect. After two nights in San Pedro it was time for the main event. Two days on the PCH with the top down and an overnight stay in Morrow Bay. We headed first thing in the morning and sat in traffic for 2 hours before we made it up to the PCH and after several days in the car already the seats became a little uncomfortable. Both my mom and I had the heated seats cranked hoping to keep the pain at bay. We finally made it to the PCH and we started getting into the curvy bits. I started pushing the little bug hard into the corners. I was not disappointed and the German engineering was really starting to show. There was very little body roll even with the top down and it did everything I asked it to without hesitation. We finally made it to Morrow Bay and filled up the car after driving aggressive and was very happy with the gas mileage. It got 27 MPG which by the way was the worst tank I saw on this 2200 mile trip. During our stop in morrow bay I had several comments like ""cool car"" and even had a conversation with a VW hippie. The next day we headed to San Fran and Mom and I had come to the conclusion that the seats are pretty bad on long trips. It got to the point that we didn't really enjoy sitting in the car anymore. Granted this was a brand new car. I think once the car had more miles on it they would become more comfortable. One the 2nd key I got behind a new mustang convertible with a man and his wife driving and I don't know if he was not confident with the car or what but even at moments when he was driving like me I was able to keep with him and felt like I couldn pretty much tear that mustang a new one on curvy road with this beetle. Anyways in conclusion the things I liked about the car is the power, the handling, and the looks. I had a couple of people comment on how it looks like an old 356 Porsche which gave me the confidence that this car is no longer just for women. The gas mileage was amazing even with my abusing the car for 4 days. I think the best tank I saw was 33mpg. The things I didn't like. The seats are uncomfortable and hope that down the road they would break in. The only other thing I didn't like was the when the top was up you can forget about seeing over shoulders. With the top up you are unable to see what is next to you on the highway and in parking lot situations. It was actually a little spooky. Other than that I was very impressed with the car.

First, my only real negative to the car: the Navigation/Entertainment System is a complete joke.  The entertainment/navigation console takes a minute to boot up.  So if you're going to use navigation, you have to turn on your car and wait a minute before you can get on your way.  Then, the screen is slow, it's small, etc.  I do like the little dashboard screen.  Overall, Google Maps is incomparably better than VW's navigation.  There's also a problem that it doesn't have standard USB power, and they just assume you have an iPhone, so no micro-USB/Android charger is available for their proprietary slot (I got a 3rd party wire off Amazon, but it's crazy slow).  Also, it has a weird bluetooth problem where it switches up music sometimes. It's just generally clunky and ugly and problematic. It does allow an SD card full of MP3s, I know that's like 2003 tech but I actually really like it.  Also, about the range: I drive with a heavy foot, mostly on freeway, I don't use the annoying auto-brake or evo modes, and I get 85 miles or so.  Before I got the car, I thought charging stations were going to be a big deal.  But unless you have charging at work, charging stations are really not a large part of the EV experience.  Even in the Bay Area, you just can't count on one being available - somebody else is parked there, and will be parked there for at least another hour or two more.  Or it's broken.  Or a non electric vehicle parked there.  You just can't rely on it 100%.  Anyway, who wants to wait around an hour to charge up enough to get home?  A better way to think about it is, every morning your car starts with a quarter tank of gas.  Sure, if there's an EMERGENCY, or you need to BARELY extend your trip past the car's range, something will probably be available.  But if you think this will be a regular occurrence for you, buy a gas or diesel car.OK, not to scare off buyers, because yeah I do love this car.

 on 11/05/15 22:13 PM (PST),Markus ,2007 Volkswagen Passat Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Note on 2.0T Engine on 2006 till 2008.0 cars," [Updated Review]:  I have owned my 2007 VW Passat Wagon since 2008.   Yes, I have experienced many of the quality issues that you can read about in the various reviews here, but most had happened early enough to be covered under my warranty  However, here is a word of caution if your are considering the purchase of a 2006 -> early 2008 Passat with the 2.0T engine (engine code BPY).  Issue #1:  This engine uses a timing belt. You really should check if it has been replaced (along with the water pump), as most vehicles available now will have higher mileage.   I knew about the timing belt all along when I bought the car, but when it became time to replace it, the dealership quote  of $1200 to 1400 for this service was still painful.   I ended up doing it myself (thank God for Youtube and Bentley Publishers), but it is quite an effort.  I also had to replace the thermostat (due to an error code .... seems to be quite common at that age / mileage).  This $38 part would cost several hundred dollars to replace if done at the dealer due to the complicated mounting location.  Issue#2:  Please do your own research on applicable Web forums:   The BPY Engine drives the high pressure fuel pump from one of the camshafts.   The fuel pump 'plunger' is driven by a dedicated cam lobe and VW had a manufacturing quality issue on a number of cars.   Over time, a little part, called the 'cam follower' can wear out and cause the fuel pump to start grinding on the camshaft.   I immediately checked this on my vehicle when I first read about this, and yes, my cam follower had failed.     I was initially quite upset and had left a negative review here, but then learned that there is a warranty extension available.   As a matter of fact, VW just replaced my camshaft, cam shaft follower and high pressure fuel pump with updated parts (so they acted responsibly.  Thank you, VW).    You still may want to check the condition of the cam follower if you are planning to purchase a 2006 - 2008.0 Passat.  Starting with MY 2008.5, the engine was re - designed (no more timing belt and different design for actuating the high pressure fuel pump),  so getting a slightly newer car may be worth the slightly higher price.",3.0,"Note on 2.0T Engine on 2006 till 2008.0 cars [Updated Review]:  I have owned my 2007 VW Passat Wagon since 2008.

I was happy to find a 3.6L AWD version. We paid $15.1K. This car is my 4th VW. I'm a huge VW fan, and have only driven VW. The good things, I like about the car: AWD system-it grips well!, the ride is really comfortable-it makes a great trip car! Leather seats (I prefer it), 6 disc in dash CD player, cargo room is huge, roof rails (I bought a rack that attaches to them), Sport shifting option (taking off is fun!), rear seats can be made flat to haul stuff (which makes a lot of room!). The bad: the clear coat on both my fenders are peeling off, my passenger door lock doesn't always work-sometimes it locks and other times it doesn't. It will alarm if the door is opened at least!, the Leather is cheap-I already have a huge tear and 2 tiny tears in the drivers seat, The film around the window, emergency brake, and radio buttons are peeling off the plastic, the rear hatch does not open when I use the button-I have to pull on the hatch to open it. I have had to send the car in for 2 major repairs. One was because the rear alignment was way off because the car had been in an accident when the former owner had it.  I don't blame VW for this, I knew it had been in an accident however I thought it was the front end of the car. I went through 2 tires before I took it to the dealership and they told me I had to repair a bent rear A arm ($700 repair). The rear alignment went from 3 degrees out of spec to 0.7 degrees. The other major repair was for a bad sensor. Over the 3 years I have the car, we have spent approximately $3K for repairs and such on the car. I thought about trading it in for a 2013 Tiguan but I only have $5K left to pay on the car and we just bought a house. I'm hoping the car will last until the next model comes out however, I am doubting the quality of the newer version considering what I have had go wrong on this car (excluding the alignment issue). I currently have ~110K miles on the car (as of 7/15). I am hoping the new wagon model (coming out in 2017 in the US) will have better quality than this model and that my next check engine light will not be a major repair where I have to shell out at least $500 to get it repaired....",3.0,"Love my car but I hate the repair bills!

Now that I have owned the car 2 1/2 years I can offer a ""post-honeymoon"" perspective. Overall I have to say that I am VERY satisfied with this car. I have driven it hard in L.A. traffic everyday for over 2+ years and it is holding up well. Unless you have driven in this type of traffic you cannot appreciate how this can wear down a car. The V-6 has plenty of power when I need to pass and the wide wheel base makes for a comfortable ride. Having said this, there have been some issues along the way that were all covered by the warranty but I felt I should still mention them. I should also mention that I bought the car with 8K miles as a VW Certified Pre-Owned which extended the warranty up to 60,000 miles.1. 18K Miles, Fuel Door Stuck - For some reason the fuel door would not unlock and I could not put gas in the car. VW roadside assistance towed the car to the dealer and provided a loaner while this was being fixed. 2. 56K Miles, Fuel Sensor - This caused the check engine light to come on and was affecting the car's acceleration. VW repaired it and provided a loaner car while it was being fixed.3. 58K Miles, Nav/Entertainment System Replaced - The Nav system would sometimes shutoff and reboot itself for no reason. This was an ongoing problem that I complained about multiple times at the dealership. They could not duplicate the problem and thought a software update would solve it but it did not. I was able to video this happening once and took the car to a different dealer. After seeing the video, they immediately diagnosed it as a hard drive problem and replaced the entire unit. I have had no problems with it since then. The only issue that some people may not like is the system does not read your text messages in the 2013 and 2014 models. I thought this was odd since it does everything else but I don't really miss it, and it was corrected on the 2015 model. Overall I am still very satisfied with the car and will probably give it to my son when he gets his license next year.**ORIGINAL REVIEW** I just bought a top of the line V-6 SEL Premium and I am loving it.

To the Chevy's credit, it was comfortable and had great gas mileage, but it was definitely not safe enough, and there were compromises in other areas. Some of which included build quality, performance, design, etc. After a lot of research about these car, and my son being a huge German car fan, I decided to test drive this car on the roads I'm accustomed to and in the way I drive. The performance is excellent, and the ride is very capable and tuned for comfort. After looking at about 15 different cars (foreign and domestic), this was definitely the best and safest car for the money.For years I have heard of so many horror stories about these cars, mostly about parts and reliability and things like that. I have had no trouble so far. This car does require some knowledge and willingness to learn, and simple maintenance is easy to do and is relatively cheap (like replacing a cabin air filter in a few minutes with a $12.00 aftermarket part). Only if you go to the dealer for absolutely everything will you see the money piling up. I would recommend doing simple things like that yourself. But really, no major problems whatsoever. Just as reliable as American cars.I was lucky to find this car, as it is a high trim car with the better engine and features. It was a one owner car, and was obviously well taken care of for the 67,000 original miles. My one big complaint about this car is the gas mileage which is about 20-24 in mixed driving. Although it says in the owners manual that you can run it on regular gas (not E85), I use the middle-grade one and my car runs perfectly.

Not cheaper, either. The air compressor went out twice, cold air return motor died, and numerous recalls. I honestly still can't believe a car could be so bad. On the bright side, I tell anyone who will listen how awful my experience with VW was. I have convinced at least 30+ people to never buy a VW with my previous experience.

I simply like the feel behind the wheel of the Volkswagens; firm ride, tight cornering and firm comfortable seats. My experience with the brand is nearly 100% positive. I do take an interest understanding key maintenance issues as recommended by my independent VW mechanic. Keys to successful ownership include using synthetic oil, Top Tier gas brands and ethanol free fuel if you are really committed.The Passat 1.8 TSI engine coupled with the smooth shifting 6 speed automatic transmission is an impressive combination. The engines ability to hit pick torque at very low RPM's got me over my believe I would never settle for anything less than a V6 engine. The 1.8 TSI engine delivers brisk acceleration and excellent gas mileage.  The option to manually shift plus the sport mode give the extra driver engagement I enjoy in the brand. In suburban driving I average around 28 MPG. I have gone as high as 39 MPG on an 800 mile freeway trip with cruise set between 70 and 80 MPH. One observation is that at 45 miles per hour the transmission goes into 6th gear taking the engine down to 1200 RPM. This low engine speed can cause the engine to lug. I generally do not worry about it. An option to avoid the lugging is to run in sport mode if you are spending a good deal of time at 45 MPH.I love the subtle look of the spacious interior. I like the classy exterior but I find it a little boring. I am not the type who craves extra attention. The Wolfsburg addition is the second least equipped version of the Passat but it has the modern essentials including heated faux leather driver and passenger seats (power seat for the driver) and steering wheel controls for the radio. I love Volkswagen's trip computer system. Those who desire more electronic engagement in their cars will find the radio system inadequate at least in Wolfsburg addition. Stepping up to the SE level solves some of the short coming with the electronics like a navigation option and backup camera. Had I been able to find a nice deal on an SE, I would have stepped up to the next level.One other note, the Hankook tires that came from the factory are a poor option.

 on 05/22/16 14:44 PM (PDT),David ,2016 Volkswagen Passat Sedan R-Line 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl Turbo 6A),The most practical mid-size sedan you can buy," My decision to buy this car began in January 2016 when I went to the midlands international auto show and looked at pretty much every car they had there. When considering all factors, including price, the VW Passat was my favorite car there (granted I didn't test drive any at the time). I noticed right away the attention to detail in the design without trying to over-design like many of the competitors. Just compare, for example, the taillight on the passat to the ""lego"" pieces other cars are using. I thought the Passat looked very well thought out, classy, and something that will still look good in 15 years. The cabin felt roomy, seats comfortable, and outward visibility quite good.Fast forward to May, a local dealership had an offer too good to pass up so I decided to take one for a test drive and absolutely loved it. I went with the R-Line and think it looks better than my 2014 mazda6, which I traded in to get it. The ride quality is nice, even with the low profile tires. I love having dual climate control and a backup camera standard. I also love that the max torque from the engine comes at 1500 rpm and remains until 4700 rpm, so the power feels adequate for most of the driving anyone would need to do (most people keep engine under 3500 rpm the majority of the time). The transmission is programmed for economy so expect it to feel like it is 1 gear too high on occasion, however, it is very responsive when needed. I also learned from the sales guy that VW uses new metal for the body panels with wax in between seams, rather than recycled metal. This is important because it will be much less prone to rust. It is also nice that oil changes are every 10,000 miles. As far as dislikes, I wish the remote starter was a little more affordable for lower trim levels. Otherwise, no complaints other than the fact that my wife gets to drive it instead of me :) . I can't comment on reliability, however, given the price they sell for I can afford a couple repairs along the way and still be quite pleased with it overall. I plan to keep this car a long time.**Update - I replaced the OEM tires with Pirelli Cinturato P7 All season tires and the ride quality is even better with very little road noise. Been averaging about 30 mpg in mixed driving.***2 year update - very minor coolant leak at a hose connection covered under warranty.

This makes the car DANGEROUS in a heavy rain.  It is also tricky finding the shut off setting on the wipers and so it generally takes at least a couple of tries.   To add to the problem the headlights are too dim.  The dealer says they are okay but they arenât.  The visibility to the right is poor if you are tall.  The seat does not go down far enough and so your view is obstructed to the right.  And if the backseats are in the up position, the rear view mirror is worthless because the head rests are too high. So we have the mid-section down all the time to see out the back.  But that kills a lot of space.  The head rests do not appear to be removable. All headrests are not comfortable for people who are 5'4"" or 6'0"" and they are hard and so even though the seats are otherwise quite comfortable, for a long trip, the car is not comfortable. The back seats only go down to about a 30 degree angle which means you lose a lot of what you thought was space for cargo.  Turning off the turn signal turns out to be a trick; you go all the way left and all the way right and eventually find the middle which turns it off; bad engineering.   The gas pedal is overactive and so there is a tendency to lurch forward.  The keys to the car have automatic locking (sometimes).  My car has been robbed twice because I thought it was locked and we come back all the time to find it is unlocked.  Again, the dealer could not find a problem.  The turning radius is pathetic; more like a truck.  Like other cars, the automatic windows are annoying because it takes an effort to open a window a crack (going all the way down and all the way up).  The red security light when the car is off is a tip off for car thieves.  Brilliant feature.  There is a ticking noise in the back that the car repair guys have no idea what it is but it is annoying on a trip.  The backup system is out of date already; not bad, but not good either.  The radio has Sirius and is otherwise too complicated.   The Bluetooth no longer works.  The gas indicator is fairly uniform until you get to the red zone.  Then you have 20 miles, but it looks like Â¼ a tank on the dial. Learned this the hard way. The gas door rusts very easily.  You have to clean it every time but it is still rusting.

The 8 gear shift is a bit annoying in that it shifts so much through acceleration to cruise. But I guess its an efficiency thing. The other super annoying feature is the auto stop shut off.

 on 06/09/18 17:57 PM (PDT),Don ,2018 Volkswagen Tiguan SUV SEL 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),SEL FWD: Outstanding Value In Class," This review is based upon my purchase of a 2018 Tiguan SEL 3 weeks ago.  It is also based upon the context of other compact/mid-size SUVs in it's class.  Do I wish it had more power, yes (I also Own a Dodge Viper, so I know what power feels like).  But it's awfully nice when you compare it in class and consider the price.  I say mid-size, because the new Tiguan is 185 inches long and provides 3rd row seating (although I never intend to use the 3rd row).  That puts the Tiguan somewhat in between some other 5-seat and 7-seat SUVs.  I bought the car for the immediate impression it gives of high build quality, high quality materials, and extremely high technology.  Before purchasing, I compared it to the Hyundai Santa Fe (much more expensive for like features), the Hyundai Tucson (also more expensive, and smaller), and the Ford Escape (good value, but too 'upright' in its exterior presence, no matter how juiced the engine that they offered with it).  I also considered, but quickly dismissed the Toyota Rav4 and Mazda CX5, the former for its juvenile styling and the latter for it's perceived lower build quality and 'plasticy' feel inside.  I wanted a crisp and handsome but efficient SUV, with a sporty edge, without paying $35K.  The Tiguan SEL is that for me.  The car feels German the minute you start to drive it, with intuitive steering.  The technology and sound system are awesome.  The full panorama moon roof is impressive.

 on 05/29/18 10:54 AM (PDT),John S. ,2018 Volkswagen Tiguan SUV SEL Premium 4Motion 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),"98% Awesome, 2% ""What the hell?"""," To start, I love this car... more than any other car I've owned (well, almost - I had a 2011 BMW 550i, but it was so expensive to buy, keep, maintain, and sell - like $40K more than this car - I don't put it in this equation).  The color, the build quality, the top-notch materials, the dealership, literally EVERYTHING except two (2) things, are absolutely fantastic.  I'll get to the two things in a second.  I leased a Habanero Orange, 2018 SEL Premium 4Motion AWD Tiguan two months ago.  I'll start at the front.  The grill and headlights look terrific.  The LED headlights are terrific, they swivel with the steering wheel and the light of the corner your turning into lights up and is actually useful when driving at night.  The auto on-off works well and quickly.  Moving back, the rims are really good looking and top notch quality.  The engine is... well, 90% of the time (this is one of the 2 things dragging the score down to 98%), great.  However, at slow speed - such as switching from a slow lane to a faster lane - this engine will scare the crap out of you.  I really mean that.  You drop the accelerator pedal and... nothing happens.  For, like, two seconds nothing happens.  What the hell!.  After two of the most stressful two seconds of your life, the engine accelerates briskly.  It is genuinely terrifying when you're not used to it.  I cannot figure out what is happening.  It does not feel like turbo lag or the engine waiting for the gearbox to shift down.  It simply feels like you have caught the engine taking a nap.  Once it wakes up (if you're not dead from the faster traffic you were trying to merge into), it kind of shakes a bit and then gets back to the business of being a really good VW Tiguan.  Everything else about the engine is great.  I've managed to get over 27 mpg on my morning commute.  I'm ok with that.  It's not spectacular, but (not counting the 2 seconds of terror noted above) considering how peppy the engine is most of the time, I'm ok with it.  The front windshield is great, the view is great, the front dash is great, the view out of all the other windows is... great.  What's not great?  What's not great is the other thing keeping this car from being really great... the windshield wipers.  I know, it seems like a small thing.  They either work or they don't, right?  Well, the wipers ""auto"" feature is simply useless.  If it just did not work, I'd almost feel better.  You turn it on through the menu screen and, once selected, your suppose to turn the wiper stalk to the first position and the auto feature should take over (I think that's how its suppose to work.  The manual isn't really clear as to whether, when armed, the wipers will work automatically no matter what position the stalk is at or is at the first position.  I chose it because it appears to be the most correct.)  I have tried every combination I can think of but the same thing happens each time.  When the feature is on, and in the first position, they work as I expected... for about a minute, i.e., if its really raining, they will come on and go faster, if its intermittently raining, they will work intermittently.  After that first minute, all hell breaks loose.  They may go full force, they may go to long pauses in-between wipes or anything in between.  What they will not do after that first minute is work correctly.  They are useless to the point that I've turned the feature off and do the wipers the old-fashioned way.  I guess i'm thankful I can turn the feature off.  Also, I don't know why this feature not working correctly bugs me so much, but it does.  After the ""HAL"" of windshield wipers, their is simply not another flaw in this car.  The seats are great and work as advertised AND are very comfortable.  The ride is terrific considering the large tires the car rolls on.  The AWD system is seamless.  All the safety bells and whistles work perfectly (auto cruise control, lane keeping, auto stopping, etc. - the camera system is the best I have ever seen.  Very clear with lots of choices of views and the back up feature beats my old 550i by a country mile.).  The speedo and tach display were the new video-screen kind.  All I can say is, I will never go back to the old analog dials.  The Tiguanâs is AWESOME!  Truly exceptional. Again, except for the 2% described above, this is the best car I have ever owned, period.  Lastly, the dealership (Honolulu VW) was terrific.  Iâve had good dealers and I've had bad dealers and these guys were truly the best of the best.",4.0,"98% Awesome, 2% ""What the hell?""

Once it wakes up (if you're not dead from the faster traffic you were trying to merge into), it kind of shakes a bit and then gets back to the business of being a really good VW Tiguan.  Everything else about the engine is great.  I've managed to get over 27 mpg on my morning commute.  I'm ok with that.  It's not spectacular, but (not counting the 2 seconds of terror noted above) considering how peppy the engine is most of the time, I'm ok with it.  The front windshield is great, the view is great, the front dash is great, the view out of all the other windows is... great.  What's not great?  What's not great is the other thing keeping this car from being really great... the windshield wipers.  I know, it seems like a small thing.  They either work or they don't, right?  Well, the wipers ""auto"" feature is simply useless.  If it just did not work, I'd almost feel better.  You turn it on through the menu screen and, once selected, your suppose to turn the wiper stalk to the first position and the auto feature should take over (I think that's how its suppose to work.  The manual isn't really clear as to whether, when armed, the wipers will work automatically no matter what position the stalk is at or is at the first position.  I chose it because it appears to be the most correct.)  I have tried every combination I can think of but the same thing happens each time.  When the feature is on, and in the first position, they work as I expected... for about a minute, i.e., if its really raining, they will come on and go faster, if its intermittently raining, they will work intermittently.  After that first minute, all hell breaks loose.  They may go full force, they may go to long pauses in-between wipes or anything in between.  What they will not do after that first minute is work correctly.  They are useless to the point that I've turned the feature off and do the wipers the old-fashioned way.  I guess i'm thankful I can turn the feature off.  Also, I don't know why this feature not working correctly bugs me so much, but it does.  After the ""HAL"" of windshield wipers, their is simply not another flaw in this car.  The seats are great and work as advertised AND are very comfortable.  The ride is terrific considering the large tires the car rolls on.  The AWD system is seamless.  All the safety bells and whistles work perfectly (auto cruise control, lane keeping, auto stopping, etc. - the camera system is the best I have ever seen.  Very clear with lots of choices of views and the back up feature beats my old 550i by a country mile.).  The speedo and tach display were the new video-screen kind.  All I can say is, I will never go back to the old analog dials.  The Tiguanâs is AWESOME!  Truly exceptional. Again, except for the 2% described above, this is the best car I have ever owned, period.  Lastly, the dealership (Honolulu VW) was terrific.  Iâve had good dealers and I've had bad dealers and these guys were truly the best of the best.","[('accelerator pedal', 'pedal'), ('morning commute', 'commute'), ('windshield wipers', 'wipers'), ('AWD system', 'system'), ('camera system', 'system'), ('analog dials', 'dials')]","['really mean', 'ever seen', 'long pauses', 'slow speed', 'old analog dials', 'full force', 'However sc', 'genuinely terrifying', 'faster lane', 'go back', 'never go', 'slow lane']","[['car', 'love'], ['nt', 'like', 'car'], ['nt'], ['second'], ['nt', 'range'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['work'], ['good'], ['one', 'great'], ['like', 'second'], ['second'], ['like'], ['like'], ['nt', 'good'], ['great'], ['nt', 'second'], ['nt', 'great'], ['great'], ['car', 'great'], ['like', 'now'], ['work'], ['work'], ['work', 'think', 'take'], ['work'], ['think'], ['work'], ['minute'], ['nt', 'come', 'work'], ['minute'], ['minute', 'work'], ['nt', 'one'], ['work'], ['car'], ['work', 'great'], ['car'], ['nt', 'work', 'etc'], ['nt'], ['new'], ['car'], ['good']]","[('build quality', 'quality'), ('notch materials', 'materials'), ('Premium 4Motion', '4Motion'), ('LED headlights', 'headlights'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('notch quality', 'quality'), ('turbo lag', 'lag'), ('menu screen', 'screen'), ('wiper stalk', 'stalk'), ('auto feature', 'feature'), ('windshield wipers', 'wipers'), ('safety bells', 'bells'), ('auto control', 'control'), ('cruise control', 'control'), ('lane keeping', 'keeping'), ('auto stopping', 'stopping'), ('country mile', 'mile'), ('video screen', 'screen'), ('screen kind', 'kind')]","['work perfectly', 'really good looking', 'best car', 'top notch materials', 'old 550i', 'old way', 'accelerates briskly', 'small thing', 'fashioned way', 'top build notch quality', 'same thing', 'almost feel', 'faster traffic', 'good dealers', 'really raining', 'work matter', 'bad dealers', 'work automatically', 'then gets', 'go faster', 'almost had', 'of shakes', 'gets back', 'useful driving', 'first minute', 'other windows', 'other thing', 'leased ago', 'once selected', 'new screen kind', 'large tires', 'correctly bugs', 'ever owned', 'work intermittently', 'Moving back', 'most stressful seconds', 'first position', 'simply feels', 'intermittently raining', 'stressful seconds', 'front windshield', 'good looking', 'other car', 'front dash']",neg

I have a love-hate relationship with it thus far, I love to drive it on long road trips (500 miles plus) and hate driving it around town.  It's very quiet and comfortable for long drives, the cruise control has smart technology, the back is very comfortable for the kids, and the gas mileage is awesome for the size vehicle.  Unfortunately, most of my daily driving is around town and it's terrible!  The acceleration of the vehicle is so weak, the best way to describe it would be a sputtering from a complete stop.  I've found a way around that, I know put it in Sport mode when I accelerate from a full stop and once I'm at a cruising speed I put it back in Drive mode.  It's a bit extra work, but I have more confidence pulling into traffic when doing that.  One of the biggest issues I have with the car that I did not notice during the test drive and of course the salesperson didn't mention was was there is NO hatch release in the car or on the key fob and there is no button to automatically close the hatch, which is very heavy!  How can an MSRP $32K vehicle (I didn't pay that) in a competitive market not have a hatch release?!?!?

 on 06/28/18 09:58 AM (PDT),KatieTR ,2017 Volkswagen Tiguan SUV S 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),This is not the car for me.," My husband leased the 2018 Tiguan & brought it home as a surprise. Itâs a nice looking car and it drives well. Itâs the day to day stuff that I hate. I have 2 kids in car seats. They are in the middle row (we have a third row). This renders the 3rd row basically useless. The only access to the third row is scooching and climbing in through the back hatch, because the access from the back seat isnât possible with car seats installed. The design of the cab makes me and my two daughters get carsick FAR more than in any other vehicle Iâve ever been in. Iâm talking almost daily. There is also something about the design that makes the sound when you open and windows almost deafening.

I enjoyed test driving the CX-5 and CR-V and while the Tiguan was not necessarily more athletic, the driving experience and interior felt a class above. This generation of the Tiguan is Volkswagen before the cost-cutting - not a volume seller, but it fills a niche for those wanting a premium feel without the Audi markup, much like the Jetta used to be stepping stone to the A4 or 3-series. Cargo space is comparable to a hatch, smaller than other compact CUV's, but just as versatile as both. As a side-note, I would pick the Jetta over both if VW would just improve the interior quality. The Golf is a great car and is the smart choice for fuel efficiency, but the looks never grew on me so the Tiguan was a good alternative. Contrary to most reviews, the interior was actually larger and more airy than I expected. With both the front and back seats adjusted all the way back, there was plenty of legroom but it comes at the expense of less cargo space in the rear. Fuel economy is not a strong point, especially since I do mostly city driving, but the performance in my eyes is worth the trade off. Once the turbo kicks in it's hard not to smile and it feels very stable at high speeds or during bad weather. The steering is a little light at lower speeds but has great feel at higher speeds. The stereo on the SE (something often overlooked in reviews but important to me) is as good, or better, than top of the line systems in other brands. In my opinion, the upgraded Fender system is unnecessary.  The good aside, I have to agree the driving position takes getting used to. The view is commanding, but the steering wheel and dash feel too high, and the armrests too low (I am 6'0). I personally like the firm seats. I would not, and did not pay MSRP for the Tiguan SE, especially since an all-new version will be available later this year. Reliability is unknown for me at this point, but in over 100k miles with my last Jetta 2.5 I had to do nothing but replace a battery.
