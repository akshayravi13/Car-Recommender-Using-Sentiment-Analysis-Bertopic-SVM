43, on 11/10/17 23:22 PM (PST),Rick ,2004 Jaguar XK-Series XKR XKR 2dr Convertible (4.2L 8cyl S/C 6A),"I really, really like this car!!"," I bought this '04 convertible used (in 2017) and to get an $87,000 car with under 40,000 miles for only $17,000, I call that a value - even if it is a few years old. Looks-wise, as far as I'm concerned this is the most beautiful car on the road! Anywhere! Ever! Period! The perfect update in body lines but still reminiscent of the legendary XKE. I can't stop looking at it! You know, anyone can buy a Camaro, Mustang or 'Vette, and they're nice cars and all, but they're a dime a dozen. With the XK, and especially the rare-ness of the ""R"", now you have class. People constantly stop to gawk and often ask me what it is. And it gives you a special feeling when you can reply, not ""Chevy"" or ""Ford""...but ""Jaguar""! The best was when I came out of a restaurant last month to find 6 elderly women ogling over it! Performance wise it's great, it is fast! Fastest on the road? No, not by a long shot, but faster than 95+% of them. There's nothing like leaving the light and being to 60 mph effortlessly (I'm talking only part throttle), looking back and seeing everyone still just getting rolling. And I always have to turn the stereo down when I do because the best music is the sound of that Eaton supercharger whine! Put the transmission in ""Sport"" mode and it snaps through the gears and if you nail it from a stop (before it shifts to 2nd, something it likes to do in short order) and it launches HARD! This car has a nearly perfect combination of looks and performance, it really is as quick as it looks. For a sports car it really rides quite nice considering its handling is so crisp. Another big plus is the gas mileage, I can easily get 28 mpg at 65 mph and that's GPS corrected for mileage over a 620 mile trip. How do you beat a car that looks like this, handles like this, looks like this, rides like this, looks like this and goes like this with nearly 400 supercharged V8 horsepower and gets this kind of mileage? Did I also mention what a looker it is too? The interior is beautiful too with the polished burled walnut and leather even though there's no place to really store anything. My biggest ""gripe"" is probably getting in, or especially, out of it. Tough, I can live with it. A useless ""3 marble"" tray in the console has a small tray and a 4 coin slot, pretty much a joke. I removed it and made a nice polished aluminum plate in which I installed a combination volt meter (because there isn't one), cig lighter socket (that's always powered now) and dual USB port as the only power outlet on the car is the cigarette lighter inside the ashtray which is only hot when the ignition is on. In this day & age you can't have too many charging ports for all your ""stuff"". I also removed the ridiculous nav system from the dash (it's user un-friendly, no touch screen controls, runs off a DVD player in the trunk (!) and the last update was before the car was even built. My 35 year old street wasn't even on it!) and I installed a nice Garmin in its place - and it looks factory. Same for the stereo. The old 2004 stereo has a 6 disc player in the trunk, no aux inputs and a cassette deck. Yeah, a cassette deck! Its did crank pretty well but I put a modern Pioneer in its place, replaced the amp in the trunk (kept the Alpine speakers, they're okay) and now I have a modern stereo that rattles the mirrors and interfaces with my phone. These few simple, cheap updates were all this car needed. Maintenance so far has been good, it's been easier to work on (so far) than I'd expected and so far parts (like brakes, etc.) haven't been out of line either. It really makes all the difference if you can take on repairs like this yourself, normal maintenance on these isn't too far out of reach of the average Joe and you'll save yourself a bundle.

The car still gets far more ""looks"" than my wifeâs '10 Audi A4 and the chassis and suspension are still very tight, noticeable difference from the day I purchased it.  It rides buttery smooth yet provides excellent feedback, on center feel, no body roll or any floaty feel even driving triple digit speeds.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the car and it has been extremely reliable.  Other than routine maintenance (2 sets of tires, brakes and rotors twice, changed out all driveline fluids once and filled with Mobile one at 75k as well as the transmission flush with Redline D4 Synthetic ATF) I had to replace a brake booster (480 at dealer), a water pump (325.00 at local shop), tie rod ends and a throttle position sensor.  I consider 1200.00 in repairs over 9 years of hard driving and setting outside darn good.  The chassis is completely rust free, paint still looks great, exhaust is still shiny steel and it the engine is very strong.  It feels much stronger than its rated 230 hp albeit rather noisy when pushed to the red line.  The 5-speed auto tranny is eager to upshift when left in normal mode in an effort to achieve good fuel economy.  Placed in sports mode it holds the gears longer, not overly, and seems to be the better overall choice for 2 lane and city driving so I always leave it in sport mode, which it retains when shut down so when you start it after setting for 5 minutes or a week it will retain the mode it was in when you last parked it, nice.  All the interior pieces show no wear, the heated Connolly leather seats are wonderfully comfortable for my 5'7"" frame and show no aging, fading, ripples nor creasing and the fronts are 8 way power.  Rear seat room is fair, fine when setting behind me but tight if the fronts are slid way back, they too are comfortable save for bit short for good thigh support but it works out because your feet rest on the floor just right.  The rear center armrest is nice and wide with two sturdy cup holders.  It has all the right safety features and then some; dual stage front airbags and a drivers knee airbag, side impact bags and overhead full length side impact bags that come out of the roof, passenger side weight sensing front airbag that also compensates for the seat position, anti-lock brakes, emergency brake assist, electronic brake force distribution, all-wheel drive, traction control and stability control (both can be disabled allowing for spinning in heavy snow with cutting power, I find it useful getting up the 30 degree hill in a foot of snow in my 2/10 mile driveway) though I donât believe the stability control is fully disabled it does allow for aggressive off-ramp fun without interference. If left on it can be a bit overcautious as I have had it cut power during hard acceleration with a tad of oversteer on an uphill reducing radius off ramp a few times right at the apex exit.  Top speed in mine is 145 give or take, which was surprising as I was sure that the computer would intervene as others had said thereâsâ would cut out at 125.  It was very stable with no floating and little wind buffeting. The 120-watt stereo sounds decent enough and I like the auto volume adjustment as speed increases.  Reception is exceptional on both AM and FM bands with no electronic interference on the AM side, which I use frequently when commuting.  It also has the Bluetooth phone module, which works without a hitch.  For winter, driving the car has heated outside driver and passenger mirrors that work extremely well as do the heated windshield washer jets.The trunk is surprisingly large and is well fitted but lacks any storage compartments.  I installed a couple of bins at the rear outside edges fastened with some Velcro to store such things as my bottle of fuel stabilizer and Marvel Mystery oil for use when buying fuel for my yard equipment.  I also installed a stretchable net a couple feet from the rear to prevent groceries from sliding forward if a hard stop is required.To sum it up, because of the issues that plaque the early models sales plummeted and never recovered even though 2006+ models are as reliable as expected from any newer car.  It can also be found at very attractive prices in the used car market and you can get a very nice highline car for the price of a Corolla yet is far more enjoyable to own.  The car was also dinged for being a ford Mondeo yet it shares a mere 15 percent of Mondeo parts.  It is fast, comfortable, tight, elegant, attractive, and rare.  It garners attention from onlookers and it has been very reliable.  I would have no reservations jumping in tomorrow and driving it to Salt Lake to visit my brother, cruising in complete comfort and confidence at 85 mph.

The first was a ""Certified"" 2014 auto ""S"" with 12k mi., the second was another ""Certified"" 2014 auto base with 40k mi., the third is a previously unregistered 2016 Jaguar executive car with a manual (an ""S"") with 5k miles.   Good:  all three look great. The acceleration with the autos is great...the manual less so.  Bad:  all three had/have defective fuel fillers, defective stereos, squeaks/chirps/rattles/buzzes.  (And the second one had a radiator hose rupture during the test drive...but I still bought it after it was fixed.)  The first two were each in the shop for a week just after purchase due to these KNOWN problems. The dealers admitted they knew there were service bulletins out for these problems, but stated that Jag won't pay them to fix these problems pre-delivery. Each was bought back.  Jag refuses to fix the defective stereos and told me it would void my warranty if I paid the $4k necessary to make it sound good.  No joke:  the $500 Fender stereo in VW's is light years better than the 770W Meridian system, which spews out muffled bass and tinny mids.  The bass is distorted in all of them. Try this:  compare bass at full with sub at zero and vice versa--not much volume from the one at full. Then, put one at full and add some volume from the other:  disproportionate volume increase and muddy distortion.

Good:  all three look great. The acceleration with the autos is great...the manual less so.  Bad:  all three had/have defective fuel fillers, defective stereos, squeaks/chirps/rattles/buzzes.  (And the second one had a radiator hose rupture during the test drive...but I still bought it after it was fixed.)  The first two were each in the shop for a week just after purchase due to these KNOWN problems. The dealers admitted they knew there were service bulletins out for these problems, but stated that Jag won't pay them to fix these problems pre-delivery. Each was bought back.  Jag refuses to fix the defective stereos and told me it would void my warranty if I paid the $4k necessary to make it sound good.  No joke:  the $500 Fender stereo in VW's is light years better than the 770W Meridian system, which spews out muffled bass and tinny mids.  The bass is distorted in all of them.

But there are weak areas. Make sure the plastic timing gear has been replaced with factory metal components. And, that the plastic water pump has been replaced with the factory metal unit. Do not buy an XJ that's been through an overheat. Look for sludge on the valve covers. The ZF automatic is ""sealed for life"" and prone to failure over 80K miles unless thoroughly cleaned out.Buy one of these cars only if you know of a non-dealer Jaguar speciality shop that can service it. (Check with your local Jaguar club.)Update: March, 2017 :  I'm not sure when I first posted my original review, but it's been at least a couple of years.Over that interval I've put on a lot of miles, including an extended road trip to Canada. Now at 148K miles and nine years of ownership I have many compliments and only a couple of complaints.On the complaining side I wish the car had better fuel economy. I rarely drive in Sport mode, and I'm not a stop-light drag racer, but my XJR does no better than 16 mpg in around-town driving and 20 or 21 mpg on the highway at 75 mph.One weakness I watch out for: the ZF five-speed automatic. It uses synthetic transmission fluid and supposedly is ""sealed for life."" In other words, you'll never have to change the transmission fluid. That's all well and good it the owner thinks the car's lifespan is over at 80K miles. But this is a 250K mile car. As metal dust circulates through the transmission over the years, it accumulates and clogs the filters and magnets and lodges in nooks and crannies. My expert mechanic went through my transmission at 100K miles and flushed everything, including the torque converter, which is a tricky operation. The result is all I could have hoped for. The fluid is still clean 48K miles after.Today's generation of luxury cars come equipped with V6s for the most part, some with inline fours, all turbocharged. To achieve my car's 400 hp (I've tweaked the Eaton supercharger), they need to boost these small engines mercilessly, and that can't be a good thing. Manufacturers are reducing engine displacement to meet government standards for emissions and fuel economy. and the new generation of luxury cars give 2 or 3 mpg more. I'll gladly keep my 32-valve DOHC V8 with supercharger. Unlike today's turbocharged cars, there's no lag on acceleration and the blower emits an intoxicating whine. This is what a Spitfire must sound like. The car makes power as new and I get a thousand miles out of a quart of Mobil 1.Since I wrote the first review my privately owned (non-dealer) Jag specialist shop has needed only to change the oil and a couple of filters and replace spark plugs. The shop's owner and chief wrench, Juan, tells me this generation XJ-series (1998 - 2003) is setting a new standard for reliability as the cars age. There is a proviso: XJs built before 2002 need their plastic timing gear and water pump replaced with factory metal parts. This is expensive, a couple thousand dollars. But one the metal components are installed, there will never be a need to fix this problem again.In summary, my affection for this car has grown, and I'm obliged to give it five stars over its previous four. Even though it's 16 model years old, the car is holding up superbly. It's still tight, the original Bilstein shocks are still doing their job, and I am no longer worried about unexpected breakdowns. I'm 67 now, and don't see the need for another car: this one will outlive me.Also holding up well are the Connolly leather (with maintenance, and always parking the car indoors, as did the original owner) and the factory-optional Emerald mica paint. Apart from stone chips, the paint looks as new, with the same intense emerald green. As with the interior, the paint's longevity is dependent on the car being parked out of the weather.I've driven the new XJ and am a big fan of Jaguar's new lineup. Finally the Germans have a serious competitor in the sports sedan arena. But without a doubt, my old XJR rides better than the new one. My car is better insulated from the road, and you hardly feel the imperfections you drive over them. By comparison, the new XJ with its 20"" wheels (as opposed to my car's 18"") and rubber-band tires just can't absorb the bumps as capably. There's no doubt it handles better on a twisty road. My XJR doesn't like tight twisties, but put it on a road with long sweepers and it's in its element.You can buy a car like mine privately on Craigs List for around $4,000. (I paid $12,500 for mine nine years ago, when it had 85K miles on the clock.) The trick to buying one of these is to purchase it privately from an enthusiast owner who has maintained it rigorously.

RUN!," I must admit that this car is one of the sexiest and best looking vehicles I have ever owned.  Unfortunately the historical mechanical issues that for years plagued Jaguar have not disappeared.  I purchased this black beauty with just 10K miles in 2013 from a third party dealer that was selling it for his client.  The previous owner was the wife of a CEO and hardly ever drove it.  Here we are July of 2017 and at just 56K miles after driving it it from Miami beach to the Florida turnpike, a seven mile drive, the engine is now blown.  No warning lights, just went into protective mode and by the time we pulled over the damage was done.  Smoke everywhere and with the family in the car fortunately it did not catch fire as gas and oil leaked everywhere. Of course the car is out of warranty (ended Nov 2015) and after a very long process with Jaguar USA HQ executive escalations the best they could do is take 50% off the retail cost of the new engine.  I spent over $18,000 to put a new engine on a luxury Jaguar that had just 56K miles on it.  All service records were provided.  It was maintained at the dealer, oil changes which are synthetic done yearly or every 10K miles.  The only thing not done was the 5 year maintenance.  The entire experience dealing with Jaguar USA was terrible.  I felt like I was on trial with them trying to prove I was a negligent owner.  In the end they decided on a ""Goodwill"" benefit of 50% discount of the retail cost of the new engine plus parts needed that were damaged.  I still can not believe that Jaguar was unwilling to stand by their product and cover this issue.  Especially considering that while the car was under warranty in 2014 a similar problem occurred and they repaired and took care of it at 0 cost.  Those records were also provided though completely ignored.  Their conclusion was based on that I was the third owner of the car and that the 5 year maintenance was not done.  Completely unbelievable! In the end we all have to make our choices as consumers.  I own an F150 which has a 130K miles and no issues, had a Benz 150K miles and no issues, currently own a Porsche 30K miles no issues as for Jaguar I will NEVER purchase another no matter how sexy they are!

After 6 months of trying to fix the leak, they finally looked at the windshield, and confirmed that the leaks were indeed coming from there.
