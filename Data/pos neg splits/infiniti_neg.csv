I finally decided to get a new car in 2017 and after looking at all the midsize SUV's available, i drifted over to the Qx70 because i wanted something fun to drive and the car had gone out of production so i felt i could get a good deal on one.  I actually got a spectacular deal on a CPO with 4400 miles on it ($36K for a car with a $52K sticker) and 42 months of mfer warranty left.  It was a corporate owned vehicle used by a Nissan exec.  My gain points out a negative- this vehicle really depreciates in its first year- so if you buy one you need to keep it.   I purposely stayed away from the sport and limited because the 18 inch wheel has a lot more air and rubber on the wheels vs the 20/21 inch wheels - it makes a difference in softening the ride. I think the big wheels look great but i wanted a more standard issue tire.   The technology is old but proven- no trips to the dealership for bugs in the driver assist functions or transmission. Nav has both touchscreen and button panel- its a little far away for touchscreen when driving but buttons are intuitive.  The car drives wonderfully.  The responsiveness is off the charts and the rear-wheel drive acceleration is smooth and powerful.  I just love driving it and it is more comfortable than i expected.  The biggest negative is the fuel economy- 17/21 with premium fuel adds up.  But i knew that going in and the deal i got will pay for a lot of fuel!

 on 01/30/17 09:24 AM (PST),JWK ,2017 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Meh...not really that impressed," I rented this car and spent 900 miles in it (I got in with 8 miles, returned with 908).  Overall, I was expecting better.  Cabin was nice and well appointed.  Buttons were easily placed and generally everything was intuitive and easy to use.  Given that it was January and I was in northern Minnesota, I was impressed by the stability control intervention, which was quick and predictable when cornering and the rear started to break away.  Kept me on the road pointed the right direction, and there was no tire spinning or anything.  As with a lot of Infiniti SUVs, the cabin is a bit claustrophobic and outward visibility is below average.  I really had to crane my neck to look over my shoulder and around blind spots.  If road conditions were at all undulating, the ride was very jumpy and uncomfortable.  You could really see it when the headlights were on; they were bobbing up and down and all of that was transmitted into the cabin.  The USB integration was sporadic.  Sometimes it would start up right away, others it would get stuck on ""reading file"" and require a lot more monkeying around with it before music would play.  But what was most noteworthy, in a negative sense, was the gas mileage.  I drove the 900 miles in less than a week, so my driving was mostly highway.  Yet it returned below 20 mpg as an average.  For a 20+ gallon tank, range was *barely* 400 miles.  I'm not a rocket accelerator, nor do I drive like a speed demon (on the interstate, I have the cruise pegged right around the speed limit).  Add to that the engine requires premium gasoline.  In this day and age, for a smaller SUV, that kind of mileage is flat-out poor.

 on 11/28/16 20:07 PM (PST),Don Finley ,2017 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 7A),2017 QX70 Limited," Owned a 2004 FX35, was the best car I've ever owned, had 240K mi when I hit a deer squarely front and center, airbags deployed, and insurance totalled the car.  Besides cosmetic damage after hitting the deer while traveling 75 mph, there was no structural or mechanical damage. I drove it home with the deflated airbags flapping.  Would not have survived in a smaller, lower vehicle. This is the first time I've bought the same car again, just a newer version. The car is gorgeous, powerful, loaded and comfortable. Already took it on T-giving trip from FL to KY.  Technology is well placed and easy to access, phone is sync'd via bluetooth, and USB cord adds all my music on board. SAT, AM, FM and aux are a simple push of a button, all with great sound. It doesn't lack anything I want, except the middle retractable cup holder on the floor in the back that the FX35 had. The gearing is growing on me; it revs high at start out in low gears, near 3000, then shifts to around 2000.  Different from the FX35, but still smooth and powerful. 21 inch tires on dark grey wheels looks awesome, and handles like a sports car.  Very happy!8 months later, I wouldn't change a thing, except the phone via bluetooth . . . it takes voice commands, then asks me to verify it got it right by picking a number, and it displays 5 names from my contact list, and the one I want is always #1.  I wish I could bypass the verification and have it just call.  I also added 3M clear bra to the front, mirrors, and door handles.  Great product, protects from bug chips and can't see it except up close if you're looking for the line across the hood.Just over a year later, still love it.  Some quirky anomalies have started with the music / phone interface, but I havenât been able to get it to the dealer to check it out. Still works, but sometimes differently than it should.  Just over 29K miles, and with oil changes, tire balance, rotation and front end alignment every 5K miles, it drives like new, still looks brand new, and my daughter says it still smells new.  Lost count of how many strangers have commented on how beautiful the car is.  Just bought an â18 Mercedes GLA 250 for my wife, and the salesman had to go outside and drool over it, and he had a $337K Maybach in his showroom.

 on 09/30/15 11:57 AM (PDT),A Fritz ,2015 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Great Performance Hampered by Horrible Technology," I owned three Infiniti FX cars - 2006, 2009, 2012.   Was finalizing purchase of 2015 QX70.The majority of the really important things on a car - safety, drive, handling, reliability - all of my cars were excellent.   There were a few areas of concern over the years, and since the model doesn't seem to have changed in over a decade, they continued to be issues.    Rear seat room was adequate, but due to the shape of the rear doors, getting in and out was a problem for some passengers.  Kids should be fine.   Rear cargo capacity was fine for me -- but this isn't going to provide the mega-capacity of some SUVs.Most recently had a car in Midnight Mocha with brown leather interior - a nice deep root beer color.   The metallic exterior paint appears as a deep, eggplant purple in many lighting situations, including daylight/sunlight.   The basic interior choices for the car are either graphite gray or light wheat.   The brown interior results in a hodgepodge incomplete look - a sort of cheap, half-finished shortcut.   Seats and parts of the dash are substituted with nice brown leather, but all other leather and trim remains the standard graphite - such as the doors, portions of the dash, etc.   Brown floormats over the basic graphite carpet looks odd.   That's poor attention to detail reminiscent of a half-finished job or a cover-up.  Since all other exterior color combos provide for graphite or wheat interior, this issue should only occur with a Mocha/brown leather equipped car.  The car was fun to drive, and had great exterior styling.However, for any driver who finds technology to be important - the FX and QX70 miss the mark by alot.   ALOT.    The software and user interface for Navigation, Bluetooth, and audio entertainment are bad.   Just plain bad.   Test other cars, and almost all will demonstrate much better controls and interfaces.   Only one USB outlet in the car, voice interface that works poorly and freezes are some of the problems.   Limited information display when using your own devices via bluetooth or USB, and even for the Satellite radio.   No ability to control music selection with voice commands.  But the most astonishing problem is the severely outdated navigation dataset loaded into new cars.   Whatever source Infiniti uses for nav-data is horrible.   Roads and business in existence for several years simply don't appear in the Infiniti's Nav.   Not even brand new cars.  As I prepared to buy the QX70, my fourth Infiniti, I decided to pay particular attention to the Nav/entertainment system.   I tried several different automobile brands.   I found that design and software varied from manufacturer to manufacturer - with many aspects of the Infiniti being the worst.   I made a list of several destinations, all established in early 2014 or in prior years, and then tested the 2015 cars from several manufacturers.   Even tested the 2016 QX70.    Not one business from 2013 or 2014 was found on the Nav dataset in the 2015 or even the 2016 QX70.   At least 80% were found in all of the other 2015 cars, and often 100%.If you don't care about user toys/entertainment/navigation --- then the QX70 is a fantastic car.   If driving a relatively high-priced premium automobile with horrible technology, out-performed and out-designed by many budget cars will bother you.... avoid the QX70.   Or, at least test these systems in the QX70 before finalizing a purchase/lease decision.   After 9 years, I decided it bothered me too much, so I switched to another manufacturer's crossover.    I'll check back in on the Infiniti when I'm ready for a new car in a few years - if the technology is updated and comparable to other manufacturers, I'll probably return to being an infiniti owner.",3.0,"Great Performance Hampered by Horrible Technology I owned three Infiniti FX cars - 2006, 2009, 2012.

Very responsive and the quality of this car is awesome.I've only had 2 repairs with this car, radiator and steering fluid replacement.Mind you, it's best if you immediately repair any issues before it gets worse because it can get pricey.

A lot of what drove me to the G in particular was it's similarities to my prior car, RWD (the G37x is RWD unless you're slipping, then AWD), power, a non-CVT transmission, and refinement. I like the AWD capability if I need it, but really enjoy receiving my power from the back end the majority of the time. Car will not slip in the rain no matter how hard you damper the pedal in AWD only mode. Had moderate snow last year, it plows through even with old tires.The G so far for me has been a pleasure to own. After working out some kinks that were covered under warranty, I have yet to spend a dime outside of oil and filter changes. Warranty eventually covered a leaking bank of my VCGs, but that's nearly regular maintenance. I did pay for a belt change, which should be the only time I needed to do this for the next 5-7 years. I may need a new bearing, but it will be covered under my remaining CPO powertrain warranty. Overall, nothing out of the ordinary. The dashboard does have a bit of a rattle at times which is likely anecdotal, and one thing I've noticed with mine that's happened to others is a whistling wind noise at 85+ mph depending on the wind resistance. Rather annoying two sounds that don't affect the performance, reliability, but do hamper the enjoyment a bit at times. The car however is now nearing 6 years old with nearly 70k miles, so some cleanup on those two issues is likely warranted.I bought it with 44k, currently has 68k. I have many 3-4 hour trips and a 12 hour ride on the odo so far, along with daily commute.Everything is great outside of very low speed bumper to bumper traffic.  The 7spd transmission is a bit cumbersome at very low speeds (0-15mph) during traffic. The cabin and driver's position really lends you to feel confident driving it. Great visibility, and the feedback on the wheel allows you to ""feel"" the road. The steering is crisp and has great radius. The weight of the car causes a bit of ""rolling"" in corners, but I upgraded to sportier all season tires (in lieu of some softer/plusher all seasons) and it nearly eliminated roll, even at 80+ mph. In an emergency situation while traveling 70mph, I had to jam on the brakes and even while sliding I felt in full control (made it out of that situation just fine, there was a huge blown out truck tire in the road I didn't see until I was right in front of it). I could be 300lbs and 6'4 and feel comfortable in the car. Currently 220 and 6'2. I'd say the car fits 4 comfortably, without the rear passengers sacrificing any leg room. Main downside is the 7spd transmission. In regular D mode, it will ride in high gears to save fuel. You can use the SD mode or full sport mode for manual changing that eliminates this issue.Overall, the value is the best aspect on the car for what you're getting. The power, interior, exterior, options (when purchased used), are all accounted for for the least cost. Couple sacrifices being the torque rating, engine noise at high revs, build quality (don't confuse with engine reliability). Build quality can be seen in the door panel fastening, seat fastening/flimsiness, and materials used. As a tip, A couple I looked at gave off a rather strong oil smell from under the hood with very few miles, which led me to believe a lot of the used cars weren't broken in properly (manual states driver must not exceed 4k rpm during first 4k miles). Generally, the used sport models were beat up, at 35k miles and above. This could have been somewhat related to them sitting on the lot, but either way, the one I settled on didn't have this problem.Some caveats: Tons of different options and packages and the pricing was not very indicative of what options the car was sold with, so it paid to do homework on what I wanted. I was looking for all the options outside of sport model, as it was more aesthetic changes than anything else (the sport model had slightly larger brakes, which results in higher bills when they need to be replaced). The premium package (including sun roof), and 18"" wheels were a must, I don't like the 17"" wheels for some reason even though they are only an inch smaller.

Also I feel the wood grain interior is a must as the aluminum didn't seem to match the rest of the vehicle IMO.","[('hour trips', 'trips'), ('hour ride', 'ride'), ('Couple sacrifices', 'sacrifices'), ('torque rating', 'rating'), ('engine noise', 'noise'), ('engine reliability', 'reliability'), ('Build quality', 'quality'), ('door panel', 'panel'), ('panel fastening', 'fastening'), ('seat fastening', 'fastening')]","['many hour trips', '7spd transmission', 'slip hard', 'Main downside', 'high gears', 'D mode', 'low speeds', 'high revs', 'regular mode', 'daily commute', 'have far', 'very low speeds', 'only mode']","[['drive', 'car'], ['nt', 'car'], ['like'], ['year'], ['nt', 'work'], ['nt'], ['year'], ['nt', 'new'], ['like', 'one'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'like', 'miles', 'year', 'car'], ['nt', 'bought'], ['great'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['road'], ['great'], ['car', 'sport'], ['nt', 'road', 'truck'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['car'], ['sport'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['drive', 'miles', 'car'], ['miles', 'sport'], ['one'], ['nt', 'car', 'home', 'work'], ['sport'], ['like'], ['nt', 'vehicle']]","[('CVT transmission', 'transmission'), ('AWD capability', 'capability'), ('belt change', 'change'), ('CPO warranty', 'warranty'), ('powertrain warranty', 'warranty'), ('wind noise', 'noise'), ('wind resistance', 'resistance'), ('speed bumper', 'bumper'), ('season tires', 'tires'), ('emergency situation', 'situation'), ('situation fine', 'fine'), ('truck tire', 'tire'), ('leg room', 'room'), ('SD mode', 'mode'), ('sport mode', 'mode'), ('oil smell', 'smell'), ('states driver', 'driver'), ('4k rpm', 'rpm'), ('sport models', 'models'), ('sport model', 'model'), ('sport model', 'model'), ('premium package', 'package'), ('sun roof', 'roof'), ('wood grain', 'grain'), ('grain interior', 'interior')]","['spend outside', 'higher bills', 'only time', 'best aspect', 'manual states', 'Rather annoying', 'Generally beat', 'aesthetic belt changes', 'full control', 'Great visibility', 'really lends', 'really enjoy', 'eventually covered', 'nearly regular maintenance', 'few miles', 'non CVT transmission', 'used SD sport sport sport sport models', 'old season truck tires', 'low speed bumper', 'prior car', 'slightly larger brakes', 'used cars', 'strong oil smell', 'fits comfortably', 'new bearing', 'likely warranted', 'Previously owned', 'even sliding', 'least cost', 'larger brakes', 'have yet', 'full SD sport mode', 'huge truck tire', 'softer plusher', 'broken properly', 'different options', 'regular maintenance', 'nearly eliminated', 'very few miles', 'however nearing', 'SD sport moderate s', 'last year', 'more aesthetic belt changes', 'very low speed bumper', 'next years', 'reckless states driver', 'rather strong oil smell', 'first miles', 'rear passengers']",neg

My wife and I like the brand a lot. We had two EX35's (too long in the tooth now despite some recent upgrades), and a Q50 sedan (one of the first). The sedan suffered from excessive wind noise from around both front doors....very irksome on the  Interstate after a while. Apparently many Q50's suffered a similar problem (the Q60 suffers a bit but I can live with it). Apart from that the Q50 was an excellent car with great performance. Lease was almost up and Infiniti offered to make the last three payments for us if we got another car. What I like about Infiniti (and Lexus also) is that their designs are so good that they don't need to keep changing them. The previous coupe was around for a long time so if you keep the Q60 for 6 years you still have a current design. We leased again. My wife is a realtor and wants to look professional when she turns up for appointments. My opinion of the design of the new Q60 coupe....gorgeous; the only way to describe it and better in the flesh than in the photos (where it still looks darned good). The proportions are perfect, the stance just right, the alloy wheels....stunning. We have the pearlescent (Majestic) white which looks just awesome. Definitely better in a light color because of the beautiful dark allows which pop against the white paintwork. Perfection on wheels. I was concerned about poor vision and blind spots in the coupe but actually it is not an issue at all. The car is a joy to drive with the 300hp engine. It sits purposefully lower than the sedan and rides on 19in wheels so it is a little firm but the steering is excellent (the Q50 was a little lifeless and vague) and the car is plenty responsive. Minimal turbo lag. Too early to comment on gas mileage but I don't expect much of an improvement over the sedan. Most of our journeys are fairly short so that will do us no favors. At the end of the day, the 3 year old Q50 sedan only had 19000 miles so we will not be high mileage drivers even when my Mazda lease is up and we don't replace it to become a one car household. I work from home exclusively now so a second car is not required. Anyway, we love this Q60. Any car that brings a smile to my face is going to be good. That doesn't happen too often. My Audi S3 in England had the same effect. So, anyone in the market for a hot-looking coupe with more than enough power and refinement, get a Q60.

I know because I've owned most of them. I've been driving the Red Sport now for just under a year... and I'm very, very pleased with the purchase.  It's a beautiful car.  Inside and out.  Fun to drive.  Fast enough.  In general terms, there aren't many on the road here in Chicagoland... so it gets a ton of looks and comments.  I also splurged for the lit front logo, which really pops the car at night. Very sharp. The other thing that separated this vehicles from similar options was the AWD.

Sure, sharp turns on a road with four inches of snow is going to create some sliding (like yesterday with my wife yelling at me) but all in all, it handles very well in bad conditions.

Since the vehicle is a sports car... there are times when it's difficult to see what's behind you... and without the sensor... near impossible if another car or person is rolling through a parking lot behind you. One more thing, the car is really beautiful, however, I think they should have added a few more external design options to clearly differentiate it as a Red Sport.

 on 11/18/17 22:32 PM (PST),Dan ,2017 INFINITI Q60 Red Sport 400 Red Sport 400 2dr Coupe AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7A),"Comparison: 3.7 VQ, 3.0tt, 3.0tt Red Sport"," This review is for the Red Sport AWD Q60.  I test drove the 300 hp version (for a week) and I decided to buy the 400 hp version.  The 300 hp VR feels similar to the 3.7 VQ engine in overall power (I had a 2014 Q50); with more low end torque on the VR that runs out of juice at around 4.5K, while the naturally aspirated VQ is still going strong to 6.5K.   The VR will be quicker off the line, and will feel faster when driving around town.   The Red Sport version, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  Much quicker from stop and awesome when needing to quickly merge with oncoming traffic on highway ramps in Chicagoland.  There is a slight turbo lag right off the line and the transmission can be slightly sluggish when shifting in lower gears.  Using the paddle shifters make this issue much worse, so I'd just keep the car in automatic and in Sport + mode for the quickest shifting.  The only way that you even notice any of this is because the VR engine in the Red Sport is so much quicker off the line than the older VQ engine; which had the same 7 speed auto transmission.   I would make three suggestions with regards to choosing options for the Q60.  First, you'll want blind spot monitors and driver assistance features; as it is saved me MANY times from changing lanes into a car that was riding behind me in my blind spot.  The Q50's visibility was fine without this feature, but the more sexy Q60 profile has one major limitation; massive rear quarter blind spots.  Also, the around view monitor allows you to park this car effortlessly, without curbing your wheels.  Second, if you enjoy performance oriented driving, I'd skip the Direct Adaptive Steering.  Version 2.0 is better, but it still needs further refinement.  The standard electric steering is quite good; much better than the older VQs hydraulic rack.  Most reviews of this car that complain about the Q60s steering have a fully loaded Q60; with the DAS option.  What a shame, as the standard rack is excellent.  The only trade off is that you do loose some additional features that are packaged with DAS (adaptive cruse control, lane keeping, etc.).  However, Infiniti still gives you 2 settings for the electric steering; standard and sport, which is great and fine for most people.  Third, please consider changing out those horrible run flat OEM tires!  The handling, ride quality, steering, and braking all improve significantly.  A tire change completely transforms this car.  You have no idea how well this car can perform with better tires.  The Run Flats on the Red Sport can kick the back end out of the car when you take a sharp turn and it will hydroplane in heavy rain.  I wouldn't even attempt to use these in the snow.  Cornering also feels unstable with stock tires and the steering is way too heavy.  Did I mention that the ride is brutal with the Run Flats, even in the ""comfort"" mode?  Before I changed the tires, I considered returning the Q60 due to the very harsh ride quality.  This would have been a huge mistake!  As with the DAS optioned on almost all test cars, all reviews that I've read that complain about both the handling and the ride quality... are also using the OEM Run Flats.  (Continental DWS 06s go very well with this model).  Also, I must say that I am happy the the gas millage.  I average 23 mpg with mixed highway / city driving.  I got 21 mpg with the 3.7 VQ.  Mileage actually improved with the addition of 72 hp!  Thanks twin turbos and better cooling.  Lastly, if you shop around you can get some really great deals on this car.  (A well-optioned Q60 Red Sport AWD can be had for the mid-50Ks).  Cross shopping, I felt that I would probably need to jump to around 80k+ to improve on this car's performance.  Even then, you may not be able to match the Q60's good looks.  Yes, I'm looking at you Lexus LC!   Oh, one last comment, the sport seats in the Q60 are amazingly comfortable compared to my older Q50s, and even the current Q50s, seats.

 on 03/17/17 15:03 PM (PDT),Jon Michaels ,2017 INFINITI Q60 Red Sport 400 Red Sport 400 2dr Coupe (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7A),A wonderful GT car with a dual personality," I am a month in to owning the Q60S Red Sport 400.  I have owned BMWs (740i, 540i & M5) & Audis (S4 Cabrio and S5 Coupe) in the past as comparison. The exterior appearance is stunning. Like truly breathtaking. I find myself walking backwards away from the car so I can look at it more. The interior design is very well done. The front seats are magic. Just outstanding from a comfort & lateral stability standpoint. Engine performance can be described as a giggle machine with a start button. Just mash the throttle and laugh. The 400bhp & 350ft/lb of torque are available from 2500 RPMs all the way to redline. My favorite move is when I am on the open freeway & impatiently slogging along behind some snow bird doing 55 in a 65 zone. I lightly tug the downshift paddle twice to take me to 5th gear and bury the boot. Good lord, the acceleration is instant and fantastic! Within a few seconds I am doing 100MPH and rushing quickly towards 120MPH if I'm not careful. I've had the car up to 125MPH so far and the stability & smoothness inspires a ton of confidence. The car just seems to sit down on its haunches the faster you go. I set the ""Personal"" mode on the Infiniti Drive Mode to ""Sport+"" engine with ""Standard"" steering and suspension.  This gives me the truest GT experience with instant throttle response & a nice, soft, cushy ride. If I know I will be on the twisties, I'll choose ""Sport+"" mode across the board. The Bose sound system is hands-down the best sounding system I've heard in any car. I know, I know. No highs, no lows, it's gotta be a Bose. That may have been true five years ago, but this system, in this particular car is brilliant. So perfectly clean, with large bass response (no annoying rattle) and crisp highs that just sing. Maybe the Mark Levinson system in the Lexus LS600H is better, but then you're paying $120k for a sedan, so... Handling is so good to the point where it's annoying. I cannot seem to get the car to oversteer or understeer. It just corners with complete neutrality. If I turn off the dynamic anti-skid nannies I could probably get the car to slide some, but I am reticent to do that until I have a better feel for the 16lb/ft of turbo boost coming from the twin chargers. You don't want to get into a slide and have your turbos kick in before the apex! Braking is strong and linear. I adapted to the brakes the first day, which is a testament to how well -- and predictably -- they stop. The car comes with so much safety technology, you almost have to be an imbecile to get into a wreck. I'm sure I can personally figure out a way, as I lean towards the imbecilic, but truly, any normal person is safer in this car than in Fort Knox. Ok, now for the less than stellar. First, the steering. The DAS steering is as vague as everyone says it is. It's really designed and set up for long trips where comfort and low-fatigue are more important than feeling connected to the car. I wish there was a way to turn it off. Shift response is inconsistent. Downshifts under light acceleration come when they feel like it. Downshifts under hard acceleration come fairly quickly, but if you've ever driven a Porsche with the PDK dual clutch, the Q60 Red Sport ain't even in the same universe. Again, you're paying less than half the price, so... Still, for $62k, you'd think a less awesome dual clutch auto-trans would be mated to this terrific engine. As lovely as the interior is, I have a few nits. There are some very specific areas where the materials chosen are just plain cheap AF. The lower part of the interior door assembly for example. Cheap plastic. The inside of the glove box, center console storage and cigarette lighter opening... The cheapest felt-like substance known to man. Like those 1970s glow-in-the-dark posters with the black fuzzy crap? Yeah, that stuff (they still make that shizz?). The rocker switch for the aforementioned Infiniti Drive Mode, and the Audi-like circular mouse control are made of hollow chromed plastic that don't feel stout when you're pulling, pushing or twisting them. Guys, really? Use real aluminum for these things for goodness sakes! We have seat heat and steering wheel heat, but we do not have seat ventilation/cooling. This is a big deal to me because I live in Phoenix, AZ. I almost didn't buy the car because of this. Infiniti offers seat ventilation on many of their other models -- as do Honda, Toyota, Ford, Chevy, Opel, Kia and Hyundai. I love these seats, but I won't have a sexual relationship with them until they have ventilation. Lastly, the exhaust note. There really isn't one. When you first start the car, there is slight growl that seems promising but once the engine speed dies down to idle, the car is almost as quiet as a Tesla. If you put the car in ""Sport+"" mode, Infiniti figured out a way to pump some exhaust noise into the cabin to remind you that you have hair on your chest, but it's just not aggressive or loud enough. I'm sitting on 400HP baby! Remind me!",4.0,"A wonderful GT car with a dual personality I am a month in to owning the Q60S Red Sport 400.

It was perfect for me...until I began expanding my family and needed more room.  Because I had such a fabulous experience with Infiniti I went back and selected a QX60 because it is a little bigger.  The good news - the fit & finish is great and gas mileage is better than expected.  I drive 70+ miles daily in rush hour traffic & I still average nearly 22 mpg.  The bad news - there is nothing else redeeming about this vehicle or Infiniti Corp.  The battery dies every 18 months like clockwork.  And, as others have stated, within months of purchasing this vehicle (with all of 12 miles on it), I began having horrible transmission problems.  I took it into the service group 7 or 8 times to no avail because it was intermittent and the techs could never duplicate it.  I was to the point of hiring an attorney when Infiniti SUDDENLY developed a 'code' that could detect the KNOWN problem I was having.  Finally, when I took it in, they read the code and BAM - new transmission.  The problem is that I have had bizarre and random hiccups with the transmission since...including a horrible clunking sound when shifting from reverse to drive.  Again, only intermittently so it cannot be easily reproduced.  I was told that, because I had the ""newest version"" of the transmission they would not replace it again.  Infiniti must have received an incredible number of complaints because 4 weeks after I had tried - yet again - for them to recognize the horrid clunking sound, Infiniti released a bulletin that said hearing a horrible clunking sound when shifting from reverse to drive (especially first thing in the morning) is considered NORMAL for this vehicle and had to do with either the motor or the transmission mounts.  That was it for me.  I have sworn off Infiniti and I warn everyone I know to not purchase one.  Unfortunately, in my state I missed my opportunity to sue under lemon laws, but I know I will never make that mistake again.  If I ever encounter similar issues with another vehicle I will immediately hire an attorney and get all of my money back (and my legal fees!).  My favorite part was when they told me they were extending the warranty on my transmission for another 30,000 miles...wait - you mean the transmission you swear is perfectly normal and refuse to address in any way?

What I do not love is the CVT transmission.  I bought the car (LOADED by the way) in April 2015.  We have certainly had our issues along the way, but BY FAR, the biggest issue is the CVT transmission.  It started after we had a transfer case FAILURE, but I won't go into the story.

Then in August of 2005 I drove past a dealership and saw a 2005 FX35 in a pearl white metallic with a wheat colored interior and decided if I could sit in the drivers seat safely, I would become the source of other peoples envy.  I have a back problem that requires exactly the right combinations to exist while getting in, getting out and of course sitting.  It begins with the height of the seat from the ground.  FX35 perfect. Next, the seat has to power recline and must offer power adjustable  lumbar support.  FX35, perfect.  Then, the seat has to be firm.  FX35, perfect.  Finally, power tilt/telescopic searing must accommodate my need to severely recline the seat back.  FX35, perfect.  I spent an hour and a half just sitting, then getting out, then getting back in, then sitting.  after an hour, the salesman came out and asked if there was a problem, I answered ""not yet"".  Half an hour later, salesman came out again and asked if I wanted to take the car for a drive.  I said ""It's not that important"".  He went silent for a moment, then smiled and said ""Take it for a drive"".  I said ""Fine, I will"".  Half an hour later I returned.  The salesman said nothing, he just smiled knowingly as did I.  I had come to understand what an incredible vehicle this was.  Beyond it's incredible, exciting styling, there was the growl of the motor, the ride, the firm, planted to the pavement handling and that feeling of pride as I left the dealership and walked toward the car I had coveted for 2 years, with keys in my hand and the legal right to drive away.  I have replaced the battery and tires, changed the oil (synthetic) and filter as required without incident for 12 and a half years.  Head lights were replaced due to a factory recall (no cost to me).  I have the car detailed every spring for the last 8 years.  To this day, when I approach my FX35, I get the same knowing smile on my face that I shared with the salesman and when I park it and walk away, I always turn around for one more look.  When crossing paths with other FX35 owners at stoplights or in a parking lot, I again exchange that knowing smile with others who own this rare source of pride and performance.  Hard for some to understand maybe, but you either get it, or you don't.  It was my plan to drive my FX35 until Infinity offered an FX styled vehicle with full electric drive train.  To my horror, Infinity announced that 2018 would be the last year they would manufacture the FX35.  They have since announced their intention to offer an electric model by 2022 - which effectively means by 2025, 7 years from now.  I'm 75 years old so I could be [non-permissible content removed] out of luck by then (dead).  Since I only drive 3,500 miles per year, I guess I'll probably drive my FX35 ""Until I Die"".  It's currently remains irreplaceable.  I don't have navigation or Bluetooth, but I have a smart phone I can talk to and will talk back, so I'm good.

My old car died unexpectedly, so I was in a bind to get something that looked good, was inexpensive but sporty and had four doors. I found this clean six-speed manual G35 on a used car website, the price was only $8700. It had 85K miles on it, was in great shape inside and out,  had 18 inch wheels, dark tint, black on black with leather interior and the Bose radio.  I only drive manual transmission cars, so I jumped on it, and I've had it two weeks now.  It's not perfect, but I seriously love this car. The GREAT things about it are: It's quick. Acceleration is top notch! Shifting is short and smooth, passing is easy, and the engine has a low roar that will get you in a good mood. It feels solid on the road. Handling is great. The styling doesn't scream ""I'm 11 years old!"" at all. It still looks really good.  When I tell people it's a 2005, they are surprised.  Other good things to note - the inside is roomy for a sports sedan, even in the back seat. Power outlets, three cubbies for storage, in-dash 6 disc CD changer, and an armrest that comes down with cupholders for the rear passengers. I like the location of the clock and the features like cruise control, seat memory, and the dash are easy to use and locate. As far as getting a sporty sedan with the most bang for your buck, a used G35 is the way to go. Now - the bad stuff is the same as other reviewers. The inside is a bit noisy - little clicks, clanks and creaks as you are driving. They are slight but you will notice them after a while and wish they would go away. I also don't know why the Bose audio is supposed to be spectacular because it's nothing special. Not much bass unless you really crank it. I'm already thinking about upgrading the head unit and speakers, because I had better factory audio in my old Mustang. The inside materials and design are also basic and nothing special. Also the turning radius seems a bit wide.  Overall though, unless you are really nitpicky about the negatives, I would recommend this car in a heartbeat.UPDATE...Edmunds asked me to update my review.

 on 07/27/16 21:21 PM (PDT),Mark ,2008 INFINITI G35 Sedan x 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),Doesn't drive as good as it looks," After owning this car for two years and driving it 15,000 miles per year, I have to say that I am quite disappointed. Itâs a very beautiful looking car and has stood the tests of time very well, and hasnât needed anything yet. Granted that mine has very low mileage for its age, I can always count on it taking me where I need to be without fail. But the driving experience is lacking in so many areas. Compared to other cars on the market, it feels very âamateurishâ. Kind of reminds me of Kia cars during that initial phase when they were trying to make the brand more appealing to consumers but still werenât tuning the driving dynamics right. The 2010+ G37 coupes and sedans are better vehicles, but as for the 2007-2008 G35 sedan, there were numerous kinks that had to be worked out. The car just doesnât feel confidence-inspiring. The whole thing is just too unpredictable and I never feel like I have proper control over the vehicle. Itâs stubborn in the way it behaves on the road and the vehicle never listens to driver inputs. The thing that probably bugs me the most about the car is the transmission. The 5-speed automatic is counterintuitive, sloppy shifting, has a tendency to hunt for gears, and rarely puts you in the correct gear required for the situation. I guess I could have went for the manual but my options were limited at the time of purchase. The gears are all spaced very close together and it always shifts too early, cutting off power and denying me a large reserve of the advertised 306 horses. In stop-and-go traffic, the transmission shifts through its entire gearset during the 10 feet youâve moved up in traffic and annoyingly holds the gears long after youâve let off the accelerator, like youâre âstuckâ in the gear. On the highway it revs at over 3,000 RPM because of the tight spacing between all the gears, making you think you were driving a 3-speed automatic. The shifting can also get pretty violent which makes driving this car a headache. Another thing that bugs me is the engine performance. Doesnât have a linear or predictable torque curve. Itâs very soft on low-end torque and needs to be revved out a great deal to keep up with other cars on the road. Engine is very loud and course sounding and because of the sloppy powerband itâs not really so much of a joy to ring out either. Most mainstream cars have more smooth, predictable acceleration and meaty grunt off the line. G35 does not have that and other cars on the road will be going faster from stop light to stop light than you. Often times I find myself missing that smooth, seamless, meaty, refined feel that my old Volkswagen had even though that car had a fraction of the horsepower. The steering feels artificially heavy, like they tried to go after BMWâs chunky/hefty steering feel but instead they put effort over feedback. Steering doesnât feel predictable or communicative..just simply difficult to turn which hampers the maneuverability. Doesnât have a good on-center feel and the steering doesnât always give you a good idea of what the front tires are doing. Turning radius could definitely be better. The brakes are soft and donât provide much confidence or linear stopping power. They feel like Sentra brakes...or maybe even a step below that. Iâve tested the brakes and the car the stopping distance is very long compared to other cars Iâve had in the past. You need to keep a big distance from other cars in front of you because the brakes probably wonât save you in a panic situation, which I find somewhat unacceptable in any modern day vehicle, especially a sport sedan. The cornering abilities are disappointing. It feels very heavy in the corners and makes you (along with your loose items in the vehicle) feel like youâre being sucked into a vortex around a slight bend in the road. After exiting the turn and getting back on the gas, literally 99% of the time the transmission wonât put you in the correct gear to propel the vehicle back up to speed.The car just drives very amateurish. While everything operates as it should going down the road, the car behaves very stubbornly and leaves much to be desired. On top of everything, the gas mileage will empty your pockets. While the vehicle has made it to 60,000 miles, I could see it needing transmission/drivetrain and suspension repairs in the future. These components of the vehicle simply feel very low-rent feel to them and I donât see them standing the tests of time. Material quality and ergonomics are also seriously lacking. Iâve seen car interiors from the â90s hold up better. Storage solutions are lacking and the armrests are practically useless. My advice if buying this car is donât be fooled by the advertised 306 horses. The car certainly doesnât feel like it was built properly for that kind of power, and you rarely ever get to use them. Maybe skip the âXâ and go for the RWD âSâ model with the manual and the active 4 wheel steering...",2.0,"Doesn't drive as good as it looks After owning this car for two years and driving it 15,000 miles per year, I have to say that I am quite disappointed.

I donât just take to the interweb anytime I get excited or angered. I donât post pictures of my dinners; I donât forward funny cat videos. Heck, the only time I have ever tweeted was when my 7-year old kicked me in the goods. The truth is I donât have time between clients, kids, and trips to the Infiniti service department to be doing this kind of stuff. But sometimes, things are so bad, you are left with no other choice but to stand up and make a stink. Thatâs the point I have reached with my Infiniti QX56. Part of me feels the need to warn potential buyers of the hell I have suffered; a larger part of me needs to sleep peacefully knowing I did not simply submit to the will of a corporation more beholden to their bottom line than they are to their customers. I will not go into great detail regarding most of the countless problems I have had with my QX56. Just know that I felt close enough to my service advisor to send him a family Christmas card. By the way, my service advisor, as well as my local service department, has been wonderful. Itâs not their fault my car has had more problems than a Kardashian marriage. Really, until this most recent problem, I was content to simply never own another Infiniti product as long as I live. Then, my paint started peeling off in king-sized sheets. I mean, itâs not flaking from rock-dings, its peeling off like clothes during spring break. No big deal, right? I mean, this is obviously a manufacturing defect, so Infiniti will have no issue paying to have it repainted, right? I mean, itâll be inconvenient, but I have gotten used to that with this car. WRONG!!!!!!! I hope you can imagine my jaw-dropping SHOCK to learn Infiniti will not pay for what is CLEARLY a manufacturing defect because paint is ânot covered under warranty.â Yes, paint is not covered under warranty and I understand why. People do stupid things with their cars, so covering paint comprehensively would be problematic. However, this isnât the result of me driving through some brush or using a particular soap for washing my car. THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT I AM BEING ASKED TO PAY TO REPAIR. I get it, really. As a company of profit, Infiniti does not have to pay. However, as a company of principle, they should certainly pay. I have been told by my dealership, which reached out to the âregional service rep,â that they will not pay to cover this manufacturing defect. So, I am no longer seeking coverage from Infiniti. I am not going to beg and grovel for a company to stand behind their product. I will, however, yell and scream to anybody within earshot not to buy an Infiniti automobile. Heck, I stopped by the new car lot (after leaving the service department) and had a ""buyer beware"" conversation with a family looking at a new QX80. They were quite shocked at my paint. I told them my car was a special ""leprosy"" edition QX. Laughs all around as they got got back in their car and drove off.   Needless to say, itâs become my lifeâs goal (not really, but a goal nonetheless), to cost Infiniti more in future sales than it would have cost them to repaint my car. Thatâs how free markets work. If I am unhappy with a product, I am free to let the world know. So, I also purchased the domain www.infiniteexpenses.com and will build a simple website detailing my woes and the woes of other Infiniti owners in similar situations. (Actually, there seems to be a bunch of owners of white, 2011 QX56âs facing the EXACT same problem, so there was clearly an issue in that manufacturing run). I will then circulate that domain through as many channels as possible to get my experience out. Iâll also post this in as many relevant forums as I can find.

My previous car was a G37 IPL, so I will mostly compare this to that and the other two cars I cross shopped this with, the BMW 440iGC/340i and Lexus GS350 F Sport. It's definitely faster than the IPL, but it doesn't feel as sporty. I can't figure out why, but I've narrowed it down to either the tires being different or because the IPL had a LSD. It just doesn't feel that great in the corners. The acceleration is really good, though. I mainly drive on the highway and it's really useful for when you have to speed up to change lanes. From what I've read, the 400HP ranking is actually underrated. But still, I actually preferred the cars I was comparing this too. I really wanted a Lexus GS, but when it came down to price, there was really no decision at all. They have some insane deals going on. The sticker on mine was $57K. The Lexus and BMW I was looking at were $59K. My monthly lease payment is $250-350 lower with the Infiniti. My payment is actually $50 lower than what it was for my IPL and this has a lot more power and technology. The gas mileage is pretty good too. I get 24mpg in Sport mode and 25 in Normal.

So in conclusion, the car looks great, handles okay, has a lot of power, interior is comfortable with a good amount of space, has all the new technology, and even gets pretty good gas mileage if you don't mash the peddle.

I will write my upfront and honest review about the vehicle after putting it to the test the past 3 days. Please keep in mind I come from a 2010 535i RWD Sport.

 on 09/01/15 14:27 PM (PDT),rogue36 ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),"Loved my G's, but the Q50 is a beaut!"," I've owned 5 Infiniti G-Series vehicles over the past 12 years, starting with the original G35 in 2003.  Needless to say, I love the car.  I've always preferred its styling, comfort, and value compared to other entry luxury sedans.  I was hesitant to get a Q50 after reading the bad press it received, but the new styling really appealed to me and the technology in my 2012 G37 was feeling old (particularly the audio/navigation system).  After several test drives of the Q50 and its competitors, I liked the Audi A4 the best, but only slightly more than the Q50 and the lease deal on the Q50 was so much better there was no way I could pass it up.  Looking back, I'm glad I didn't get an A4 -- its styling is so boring compared to the Q50.Overall I really like the Q50.  The powertrain is excellent - smooth acceleration and quiet at highway speeds.  The cabin is comfortable with nice feel to the materials, supportive seats, minimal wind and road noise, and good visibility.  The Bose ""studio on wheels"" is thankfully just as good as it was in the G37.  I didn't get the Technology Package (which I somewhat regret) so I can't comment on all the cool ADAS features.  I like the car, but I do have two reservations: the steer-by-wire system, and the infotainment system.I wanted Around View Monitor to help with parking in my cluttered garage, and I really like entry/exit assist where the seats and steering wheel move out of the way to make getting in & out of the car easier, but to get these two features I had to take the ""direct adaptive steering"" system.  I'm not a professional driver, but even I can easily feel the difference between DAS and the hydraulic steering gears used on the G-series in the past, and I prefer the old steering feel.  That said, it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I use this car for my daily commute on boring mostly-straight highways.  After three months I can honestly say I've gotten used to the DAS feel and it doesn't bother me anymore.  In fact I appreciate the lightness of the steering while making low-speed maneuvers.  I did however have one incident where I was taking a tightly curved on-ramp at excessive speed just for the fun of it (which I did all the time in my G's) and in the middle of the maneuver I felt the car turn in slightly without me moving the steering wheel.  It scared the heck out of me.  I don't know if it was the DAS system making an adjustment, or  something else happening, but it was very disconcerting.  Bottom line: DAS makes me nervous and I would prefer not to have it.As for the infotainment system, it has a nice set of features but the execution is bad, not terrible, but bad.  I have a lot of complaints about the system, but I'll limit myself to just mentioning two of them: 1) When listening to HD Radio the song title and artist name do not appear on any screen anywhere.  Not on the radio screen, not on the navigation screen, and not on the instrument cluster screen.  It's ridiculous.  I eventually found that information buried two levels deep in the ""controls"" menu, where it makes no sense for it to be and is basically useless.  When you listen to music from your phone or iPod the song title, artist name, and even album art are prominently displayed -- why wouldn't they do the same for HD Radio?  Even more crazy, if you turn HD Radio off you do get the song title and artist name displayed - though in the old style scrolling text format.  It's really frustrating and I hope Infiniti offers a software update to fix it.  2) I like to put my iPod or phone into random mode and just manually cycle through my songs.  Weirdly, in the Q50 there is a span of time where you can't hit ""next"" to go to the next song -- the system says ""retrieving album art"" and won't respond no matter how many times you hit the button.  That window of time seems to be from 1 - 3 seconds after a song starts playing, which can really be annoying when I hear a song I rather not listen to and want to quickly skip to the next one.  I either have to hit ""next"" immediately or wait 3 seconds.  It's a minor thing, but still, didn't anyone do user testing on the system?Anyway, it is a great car and I am happy with my purchase.

 on 08/21/15 19:40 PM (PDT),PsyMed ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Direct Adaptive Steering performs poorly," Edmunds full expert review has nothing good to say about the Direct Adaptive Steering option, and now I know why.  My new, fully loaded Q50 Premium hash Direct Adaptive Steering and run-flat tires.  After driving it over 1000 miles on mostly highways, I'm deeply troubled by the rather abysmal performance, road handling, and maybe even the real-world safety of this steer-by-wire system.  (As of this writing, I do not know the extent to which the rather miserable run-flat tires may be contributing to this poor performance,  but I suspect it may be quite significant. I will have more to say about these tires shortly.)  For those who may not be familiar with Infiniti's Direct Adaptive Steering (""steer-by-wire""), there isn't a conventional mechanically coupled linkage between the steering wheel and the front end.  Rather, the system relies on an electronic interface between the  steering wheel and the front end.  Thus, unlike conventional steering, there is no instantaneous telegraphing and biomechanical feedback of the sensations that a driver normally feels between one's hands on the steering wheel and the road, particularly lacking the natural progressive resistance that one would normally feel as the steering wheel is turned ever more to the left or to the right.  The lack of this natural  sensation between the drivers hands and the road would be totally unnerving and disorienting.  So, Infiniti has attempted to simulate this sensation by driver selectable settings found within the Infiniti Drive Mode Selector app, found by scrolling through the apps on the touch pad.  After tapping the DMS app, one first selects Steering, after which one has four steering modes between ""Effort"" and ""Response"" to choose from, including (1) Light/Casual, (2) Standard/Standard, (3) Standard/Quick, and (4) Heavy/Quick.    Basically, the settings determine the degree of resistance one feels when turning the steering wheel.  With DAS, the  vehicle has an unnerving habit of wandering, floating, and swerving or yawing from side-to-side, requiring nearly constant steering corrections.    Unlike conventional steering, when one is negotiating a curve on a highway with DAS,  you can't simply turn the wheel in and hold it there as you progress through the curve.   If you attempt to do so you will quickly find that a few seconds after you turn the wheel slightly, the vehicle will stop going in the direction of the turn and will begin to go straight, so you have to keep turning the wheel back in the direction of the curve.  This in turn results in the vehicle wandering from side to side. But wait, there's more.  With DAS, the vehicle tends to fall into and follow, for example, any uneven seams or other such things in the road surface. In addition, when one is passing, or being passed by trucks (and even other cars) the wind drafts will blow the car to the side and require  diligence with the steering  wheel because one must anticipate and compensate for this.   I cringe to think how it might perform when driving on the freeway with strong gusting winds and slippery road conditions.  On the bright side, my experience thus far has been that DAS  performs decidedly better when driving around town as well as on country roads.   Quite frankly, I am utterly baffled as to how this steer-by-wire system ever made it into production.  What in the world were they thinking?  It remains to be seen whether or not there will eventually be a Technical Service Bulletin about this glaring problem,  and if so, whether or not a firmware update will even be possible in order to fix the problem.  While driving on highways with the Driver Assist is on, the vehicle will wander/bounce back and forth within its lane if you let it, rather like a bobsled.   In fact, unless you're very diligent about keeping the vehicle on track, the degree of wandering from side to side has me worried that I might get pulled over by the police for driving is if I am intoxicated!  My experience thus far has been that the vehicle wanders the least in the Heavy/Quick setting. As previously mentioned, I remain very suspicious that the run-flat tires may be part of the problem, and  I would be very curious to see how it performs when I eventually replace them with a set of Michelin Primacy tires.   The Internet reveals that the majority of consumers don't like run-flats because they impart a rough ride; they cost a third more than conventional tires; and they wear very quickly.   I find it to be absolutely infuriating that the automotive industry is increasingly cramming these tires down our throats.  Indeed,  I have read reports that BMW for example may void the warranty if these tires are replaced with conventionals. Fortunately, with the 2015 Q50, these tires can be replaced with conventional ones without voiding the warranty.  In addition, the vehicle has a spare tire that can be replaced with a conventional one.",2.0,"Direct Adaptive Steering performs poorly Edmunds full expert review has nothing good to say about the Direct Adaptive Steering option, and now I know why.

The car has had 4 recalls already (took 3 tries to fix one of those - passenger's air bag module). It's a gas guzzler in city driving. The CV transmission is non-responsive and sluggish. The supposed All Wheel drive is fake. It's a two wheel drive on the 4WD model with an option to activate the 4WD in a snow mode drive only. And then the rear wheels operate  only at 50%. The radiator fan motor went out at 34K miles, but somehow the warranty doesn't cover it and the dealership is charging me $1,300 for the repair. When you buy a car for $50K, you'd expect for the car not to start falling you at 34K miles. Engine began overheating because of the broken fan motor.

(I almost went with the Genesis, but the Hyundai dealership here was [non-permissible content removed])This Q60 Sport is a great car...except for a major flaw, and a few minor quirks. I won't spend time going over every little thing that you can read about in any good review of the car.  It's a blast to drive, VERY quiet, VERY comfortable, and has all the tech a spirited driver could ask for.  The driver's seat is one of the best I have ever planted my butt in, the controls are intuitive and well-laid out (though I would now recommend the shift paddles on the wheel), and I've never been able to get the car to lose its cool, even in a good rain!  The suspension is dialed in JUST right in my opinion - stiff enough for excellent handling, and supple enough to handle the 3rd World condition roads we have here in Hawai'i.  Visibility is good, and with the reverse sensors and camera, you're able to see it all.  Brakes are super and haul the car down fast.The engine is a dynamo - it puts my old stock TT to shame.  I don't get what a lot of reviewers say about the engine being noisy - hell, for a 330hp V6 that has a 7000rpm redline, it's smooth and gives all the right noises (Be SURE to get the optional ""sport exhaust"".  Even though Infiniti won't say it, I'm pretty sure it's the IPL exhaust, and lets the engine put out a few more ponies to boot.  Regardless, it sounds great, and I get a big grin every time I rev it!)The major flaw - the transmission.  The 7AT in this car is VERRRRY slow in regular drive mode.  The tranny in my new Ford paratransit van is better...and that is a horrible thing to say.  I've had the Q60s tranny software updated, and the tranny STILL just sucks.  Basically, it acts like it was programmed for best fuel economy and not performance! When warm, there is a hesitation from a stop - like the torque converter is bad; same thing happens around corners occasionally; and at other times it feels like the tranny is having trouble deciding what gear it wants to be in. This gets really frustrating with that 330hp on tap!  I drove a QX50 loaner once, and that car embarrasses my Q60s acceleration.  The problem almost goes away when the tranny is in DS (manual sport) mode, but the shifts are still a little slow and the takeoff balky.  The transmission in this car just kills the experience.[UPDATE: - It appears the problem with this transmission is in the engine and transmission controllers - they don't handle a car using ethanol fuel (which we mainly have here in Hawai'i) when the ambient temperature is around 90 degrees.  I've switched to non-ethanol fuel, and/or dumping a bottle of octane booster in the tank, and this pretty much resolves the driveability problem.]If you decide to get a Q60 coupe, and love to drive - get the MANUAL transmission.  I'm glad I only have a 2-year lease on this car.  That's how badly the tranny irritates me.My first little quirk is with the Climate Control.  I've had a number of cars with Climate Control, and it appears Infiniti decided to do things a little differently with their version.  For example, if you just want fresh air - you have to shut the system off, then turn on the fans, then lower the temp setting as far as you want, and then turn the A/C on, and then off.  Ridiculous!  If you don't do all those steps - even though the panel says NEITHER the temp control nor the A/C is on, they continue to work anyway!  Oh, and you can't have recirculating air unless the A/C is on.  There is also sunlight sensors on the dash that seem to override the temperature control.  In most cars I've always set the temp at 75, left it there and been happy.  With this car, I have to keep changing the temp settings to keep from freezing!Second quirk is with the doors.  The doors are damn heavy, and if there is any kind of strong breeze blowing, they are a bitch to open, and almost impossible to keep open!  I've had to come up with a new ""exit routine"" to keep from getting a leg caught in the door as we usually have healthy Trade Winds here in Hawai'i.Last quirk - to me, even the upgrade Bose sound system's speakers sound muddy - NOT what I'm used to, as my 300zx had a Bose system.  The ""driver's stage"" setting on the system is cool - it's like surround sound, but the speakers need to be wayyyyy crisper in my opinion.  Subwoofer is pretty good, and it's nice to be able to tie my phone audio directly into the car system with a couple of button pushes.",4.0,"It's ALMOST perfect.... I should probably start this off by saying I am a long-time Nissan fan.My previous car was a '95 300zx TT that had been meticulously maintained, but was just getting...well, old.
