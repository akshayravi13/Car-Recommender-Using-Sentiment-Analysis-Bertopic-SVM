 on 08/12/16 09:59 AM (PDT),Peter Ghosh ,2016 BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Significant improvement from the prev. generation!," I had a 2014 X1 (prev generation) that was my favorite car ever, but was coming off lease. I expected this new generation of X1 to be fair since it was being molded to look like the rest of the X-line family (truth be told, I wanted the Tesla Model 3 but couldn't wait that long). I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is actually more fun than the last one. Slightly less horsepower, yet the 0-60 is quicker. The move to a front-wheel-emphasized 4WD is not noticeable. I sometimes miss the hydraulic steering (however, the 2016's adaptive steering makes parking and city driving much easier). I got every tech package except the ACC (c'mon, an extra thousand, really?) and it seems worth it. By adding a few extra PSI to the tires (compared to the door sticker), I am getting 35+ MPG on the highway! Eco-mode is much more useful now without sacrifice (I especially didn't like the jolt on the 2014 when I needed to pass someone on the highway due to the shift timing change in this mode). The interior materials are a step up (interior lighting at night is especially top notch). The rear view is crowded compared to previous gen (due to smaller rear window and seat back obstructions), but not dangerous. The front seats are narrower than the last model and could use a little more cushioning as well - make sure you like them first vs. ordering the sports seats/package. I am 5'8 at 175 pounds so the base seats work for me. Overall, It's more luxurious, quieter and more fun than the previous generation (which was already great). I will have a hard time giving this up in 3 years.",5.0,"Significant improvement from the prev. generation! I had a 2014 X1 (prev generation) that was my favorite car ever, but was coming off lease.

 on 01/07/17 19:45 PM (PST),Harry ,2017 BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),First BMW," We shopped around for quite some time looking for a small/midsize crossover. We test drove literally dozens of vehicles: Mazda, Audi, Benz, Honda, Ford, to name a few. We were between the Volvo XC 60 and the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. We loved the Volvo but the price at $52K out the door was a little more than we were willing to pay. We were about to settle on the Hyundai (even though it didn't drive especially well) when the night before I read an article about the X1 and figured we'll go check it out before settling on the Hyundai. To our delight, we loved the way the X1 looked, drove, and its interior is bigger than it seems from the outside. The trunk was the biggest surprise to us with the underneath compartment. We loved the car. We compromised on the base X-Drive model MSRP of $36K but got them down to $33K. We took it home that night and have been enjoying it ever since. Nearly 1 month later, we have gotten a good feel for the X1. Our biggest complaints have to do with some basic features lacking in the base model which we knew going in. The fully loaded Hyundai had all the features I'm talking about i.e. LED Headlights, XM Radio, Blind Spot monitoring, Sunroof, backup camera, adaptive cruise, forward collision warning, integrated sunshades, heated seats, navigation to name some big ones. The X1 does have some of these features if you elect certain packages but the price will quickly climb into the 40's and beyond. Ultimately, we chose the BMW because it drove 100 times better than the Hyundai and at the end of the day, no matter how much you dress up a Hyundai it is still a Hyundai and drives as such. We've been averaging 25MPG combined which is better than all the other vehicles we tried especially with an all-wheel drive. Besides our lack of options our only other complaint really is the suspension. As expert reviewers have stated, the X1's suspension is very stiff and you feel it when you go over speed bumps or bumps in the road. But I still prefer the stiffness over the squishyness of the Hyundai's body roll suspension. Another weird thing our X1 lacks is the ability to control the rear dome light from the rear. It's an odd design flaw but we'll get over it. Ultimately, we are very pleased with our decision.",4.0,"First BMW We shopped around for quite some time looking for a small/midsize crossover.

Currently own a 911 Porsche and Panamera along with a 650 Dodge Ram and Toyota Four Runner.  I've owned BMW 550 and 740 as well.  This is the best driving vehicle of the lot.  It's still a big vehicle but doesn't handle like one.  My 911 is a 1999 and rides like a Go-Cart.  The Panamera feels like a big car.   Now that I'm in my 50's I much prefer sitting a bit higher and knowing I have the acceleration and stopping ability of a much smaller vehicle.   It is the most fun I have had driving any vehicle.  I'm not fascinated by the look of the vehicle, but then that's what lured me in.  I like to drive fast and don't want to be conspicuous.  Most folks simply don't know how much power this SUV really has.  It will blow both of my Porshe cars off the line.  Excellent braking has saved me from a couple of certain accidents over the past 5 years.   The downside is kids have a difficult time seeing out of the back seats.  And there are only 2 back seats.  I wish there was a bench seat option so we could carry 5 passengers.   My daughter is now practicing for her driving test and I let her drive my X6M.  She didn't like the vehicle having spent her life in the back seat.  The fully adjustable seat allowed her 4'10'' frame to adjust to a position where she could see well and feel very comfortable.   After her first drive she expressed that ""your car is way nicer than the Toyota!""  She needed to adjust her foot pressure on both the accelerator and the brake.  Both are far more responsive than the other vehicles we have.   My X6M is the best car I have ever owned.  My wife expected me to be looking for a new car and asked me about it.  I told her I'm happy with the X6M.  As long as I can get it detailed I'm good for a couple more years at least. Oh, the gas mileage is poor at about 15 mpg and the gas tank is small ~20 gal.

It came with 3 months/3k miles warranty. I thought great! It made me confident that it would be a reliable car if the dealership warranty a used vehicles. First off, i love the way this car looks. I considered it cosmetically flawless for an 07 truck. Shines like a pretty penny. It came with 3rd row seats and 2nd row entertainment dvd center. I've owned 3 bmw sedans in the past and loved it. In the first 3 months I've noticed few things. Power steering was a bit heavy. 3rd row seat is extremely tight with leg room, but at least we have it. No spare tire with 3rd row option which was expected, but they dont even have a jack? Once the 3 months passed, the problems begins. It has been continuing issues after issues that never ends. I've owned this truck for a year now and put on less than 5k miles on it and it's time to get rid of it before it becomes more of a money pit. Something about the yaw control that makes the vehicle jerk during take off from a dead stop when the car is still cold in the first 30 mins of driving it. Passenger AC/heater vent motor grinds inside the dash when turning or making a right turn. Now the passenger climate control only blows warm air even when the AC is in full blast but the driver side blows cold. Air suspension deflates over night and you can hear the pump running when you first open the door to inflate it and level the rear of the car. Now it deflates after it sat for about 2-3 hours. Driver passenger LED tail light went out. No way to fix it, but replace the whole tail light assembly. Dvd navigations takes a long time to load and it gets really warm. Rear camera clarity is soo poor that at night it was unuseable. It started leaking oil. Came to find out, the head gasket needed to be replaced. While replacing the head gasket the brittle breather hose needed to be replace because it was guarantee to be broken when you have to take this hose out to remove the head gasket. It never ran the same since then. Rough idles when its cold for about 30 seconds then it was fine. Now the water pump is out and recommeded to replace the thermostat while its being fix. The water pump is plastic electric design and the thermostat is also enclosed in plastic housing assembly. And the location of the water pump and thermostat is impossible to get to that you have to remove the wheels and wheel well to give a little more room to get to it. $560 for the water pump, $170 for the thermostat, 3 magnesium mounting bolts that needed to be replaced and cannot be reused. And 3.5 hours of labor at $175/hour. Right stage two brake light keeps coming on, ive replaced all the bulbs and still comes on intermittently. Lastly, the truck goes to neutral from drive position when you just started moving from a complete stop in the middle of the street while the engine is still running. You cannot just throw it back into drive, you need to press the brake pedal, turn it off and restart the car to put it back in drive. It happened 3 to 4 times so far when my wife was driving it and was afraid that she would get rear ended cus other drivers doesn't know that your car just stopped in neutral position. HUGE SAFETY ISSUE! Called BMW and ofcourse you know the answer to this. This is the first time they are hearing about it when hundreds of others online experiencing the same problems with this safety issue. No oil dip stick. Computer monitors shows how much oil you have. No engine temp gauge unless you unlock certain computer codes to display it on your cluster gauge. Time to get rid of it before something else major needs fixing. Heres the good. Great looking truck! Easy do it your self oil change and filter. No issues with little problems all has been big jobs.

For 3500 dollars you're getting quality, luxury, awesome comfort, saftet, AWD which basically makes it worth 3500 just for it being an awd, the x5 3.0I run great, i bought one after i sold my 1988 corvette with modifications and a terrible interior. This 2001 BMW X5 puts my 2007 Lincoln Navigator in it's place it's that reliable and comfortable to drive. If the door handles are worth writing a complaint Youre wasting time not fixing an easy problem. Yes theres a few small problems here and there but I've never seen an SUV as loaded and well performed as this BMW X5.  I come from a classy NFL football family and have seen plenty of my share of luxury and sport cars as well as exotic and super cars, the best car Ive bought is a 2001x5 3.0i with 180k miles, i happily gave my fiance the keys to navigator that's how happy i am with this old thing. ***Also those who aren't tech savy or into the whole technology age this is the right vehicle to start out with because it literally has everything thats easy to learn without reading about. The horsepower differences are why I'm on here writing a positive comment about these X5's. Great gas mileage considering a 225 horsepower SUV. Lincoln Navigators get half the mpg city and highway compared to the x5's. The 2001s also accelerate when you need it to perform at those right times. They have front and rear sensors, also they have alarms at least mine came with them so maybe thats why the handles are causing trouble. It's really the neatest high end suv im proud to drive and talk highly about. I get so bored of cars in 2 months, but mine has been with me for 6 months and I dont want another suv. I already spent 3,000 grand on a few parts.  Give it a chance and see how right it feels it's worth fixing to me. Thank you BMW for making the most reliable SUV. Good luck everyone.",5.0,"Seriously?

For 3500 dollars you're getting quality, luxury, awesome comfort, saftet, AWD which basically makes it worth 3500 just for it being an awd, the x5 3.0I run great, i bought one after i sold my 1988 corvette with modifications and a terrible interior. This 2001 BMW X5 puts my 2007 Lincoln Navigator in it's place it's that reliable and comfortable to drive. If the door handles are worth writing a complaint Youre wasting time not fixing an easy problem. Yes theres a few small problems here and there but I've never seen an SUV as loaded and well performed as this BMW X5.  I come from a classy NFL football family and have seen plenty of my share of luxury and sport cars as well as exotic and super cars, the best car Ive bought is a 2001x5 3.0i with 180k miles, i happily gave my fiance the keys to navigator that's how happy i am with this old thing. ***Also those who aren't tech savy or into the whole technology age this is the right vehicle to start out with because it literally has everything thats easy to learn without reading about. The horsepower differences are why I'm on here writing a positive comment about these X5's. Great gas mileage considering a 225 horsepower SUV. Lincoln Navigators get half the mpg city and highway compared to the x5's. The 2001s also accelerate when you need it to perform at those right times. They have front and rear sensors, also they have alarms at least mine came with them so maybe thats why the handles are causing trouble. It's really the neatest high end suv im proud to drive and talk highly about. I get so bored of cars in 2 months, but mine has been with me for 6 months and I dont want another suv. I already spent 3,000 grand on a few parts.  Give it a chance and see how right it feels it's worth fixing to me. Thank you BMW for making the most reliable SUV.

The car was never red lined or even close.The car is fun to drive but very expensive with excessive repairs.All recommended maintenance, oil changes, brake pads, brake flushing, alignment, etc. were done on or ahead of schedule.The car has 85,000 miles on it and has had over $14,000 in out of factory warranty repairs.The dealer labor is $150+ an hour and the dealer parts are 1.3 to 3 times more than the same OEM part when available outside.The AC leaked during the 50,000 warranty and a connection hose was replaced.  Everything else failed and was repaired after 50,000 and by 85,000 miles.Most failures have been acknowledged by the dealer and on the internet to be a common failures on a BMW V8 engine.Repairs:Head light washer nozzle came off and was replaced.Water tank split at seam and was replaced.Vacuum pump leaked and was replaced.Oil seals on front of engine leaked and were replaced.Front end bushings were worn and were replaced.Engine valve cover gaskets leaked and were replaced.Engine Valve seals leaked and were replaced.Fuel pump leaked  vacuum and was replaced.I recommend you not own this car after 50,000 miles unless you have an extended warranty.  Thank goodness i had one.UpdateThe car now has 106,000 miles on it.The fuel pump has been replaced again.My extended warranty company has spent over $21,000 in repairs at the Dealership.BMW issued a recall over a year ago on the passenger air bag but has not replaced it yet.I stand by my earlier report.UPdate againThe car has 111,000 miles on it.The passenger seat airbag recall has not been replaced.   BMW does not have the new airbag but they continue to sell new cars with. presumably new good air bags!At my last dealer inspection, I was told I needed to replace my rear brake shoes which had less than 3 mils thickness left.  It had only been 25,000 miles since the original pads which lasted 85,000 were replaced.  I took the car to a second dealer.  The rear brake shoes  had 6/7 mils.

Horrible experience started after a July accident, when a towing truck lost control spinning on highway and smashed to my passenger side door. The car was towed to Russel Collision Center in MD, it took them more than THREE months to ""fix"" it after repeated delays and excuses. There were a lot of visible and electronic problems when they said it was ready to be picked up. Then they tried to fixed them over and over. Finally you thought all should be good. Actually the nightmare just started. Over the weekend, I drove to NY. The ""Malfunction - Battery not charging"" message appeared. After contacting the Road Side Assistance (RSA), I decided to continue my trip as the car was moving OK. On my way back Sunday, the same message reappeared a few times before ""Drivetrain Malfunction"" appeared, and the car started shaking with all warning lights on. What a scaring moment on I-83 near York! I managed to stop the car over the shoulder.  I contacted RSA and it took me almost two hours to see a towing truck coming.

No kidding, the tow truck broke down after about 15 min while the driver was on his handheld phone all the time gossiping. I eventually had to take a uber home. This morning I contacted BMW Catonsville and they confirmed the car was towed there and they were ready to repair it. I was told by Text message, ""looks like we had a programming recall for the vehicle, i believe this squared away all these issues"" (the issues I reported included: Clicking noise, not working hybrid system, seat position button not working, USB phone button won't pick up incoming calls besides the battery not charging and malfunctioning drivetrain, etc.). If there's a serious recall, why the customer was not notified immediately, instead putting my entire family on risk. After I picked up the car this afternoon, the very first thing I noticed was that there's no power to the rear mirror (meaning you cannot program your garage door opener), which they fixed once couple of weeks ago. And the memory seat position button still not functioning. I have no idea how many more issues will be discovered and how much hassle I have to deal with on my busy life schedule.

I would have opted for the Alpina B7 had it been avail but due to timing I opted for a 750i xDrive.  Although not quite as fast as the much more expensive Benz I traded, this car is far more engaging and athletic to drive. The 4.4L V-8 is silky smooth and the transmission programming is spot on. On a car with as much technology as these high-end sedans have, I much prefer the interfaces and user-friendliness of BMW's approach to controls, infotainment, and gizmos (exception of the seat controls.... MBZ has the best placement for seat controls).  The drive settings provide a cadre of options ranging from pillow soft to firm. Perhaps I haven't discovered how yet but I'd like the car to stay in the mode I last drove it in (defaults to comfort every time I start it up). In all drive settings the car performs admirably on road trips over varied pavement. I do notice more dramatic pitch from the front suspension than I am used to in a BMW under hard braking or hard acceleration.  I don't opt for the 21"" wheels based on other's reviews that they are overly harsh. I am running the 20"" M-Sport 5-Spoke wheels on Pirelli Run-Flats and they seem to be a good compromise. I am sure, as with all other BMW's I've owned, performance comes partly at the price of accelerated tire wear. This being a long wheelbase all-wheel drive 7-series, I expect 12-15K miles out of a set of tires tops....  The Bowers & Wilkins Stereo is worth the coin and far superior to the top of the line Burmester Audio in the Benz (Speakers in my AMG were poorly designed/installed and housings began resonating badly very soon after purchase). My initial impressions on the new 7 series are positive and my hope is I still enjoy my seat time in this car in year 2, 3, and beyond. I believe BMW's biggest strengths in this segment are in it's general user-friendliness of high end features and general quality implementation and refinement of all systems.

My problems were the crazy electronics and dealer handling.   1st problem--it has automatic rain sensing wipers, but unlike other cars with automatic wipers, you have to manually turn them on every time so they will  work.  so they should be called manual wipers.   2nd problem--the parking sensors have to be manually turned on every time when parking.   they automatically turn on when backing up, but if you are parking they don't come on unless you turn them on every time.   if you are used to sensors that are automatic on other makes of cars, you can hit something thinking the sensors are working when they are not.  3rd problem.  the tire pressure monitors freak out with any change of temperature and when they do, you have to take it to the dealer to get them to reset it(this happens about once every week in oklahoma or so).  you will get sick of going to the dealer because you cant reset it yourself and it wont let  you go into sport mode with a tire error.   it also over rides the backup camera and you can be backing up and the camera will shut off to warn you about the tires which can lead to an accident.  4th problem. 5th problem--while the phone connects automatically (with a long delay) to the car, it often wont connect the audio so you have to go in every time to manually turn it on.   this is about 5 screens into a menu. this occurs about 90% of the time  6th problem.   the audio never remembers where you left it tuned.   it will start up in stations i never listen to or settings that i don't use.  i bought it new so these are not the previous owners settings.  7th problem   the car on several occasions opened all the windows and sunroof over night(twice when it rained) for no reason.  not a pleasant thing to wake up to.  8th problem--the tailgate can be opened on the remote while in drive.  if you put a key in your pocket or purse and it bumps the tailgate button, it can open on you while driving.   this has happened numerous times at stoplights and drive-thrus and will freak you out and make you get out of the car to shut it manually as a risk of getting run over at a stop light.  9th problem--the run flat tires cannot be fixed, only replaced.   they also wear out extremely fast on the X3 you will get about 25k miles before they have to be replaced.   the 650 only gets 15k miles between replacements.  you have no spare or place to store one so switching to better tires that are not run flats leave you with no spare if you do get a flat  10th problem   too many things are settings in the i-drive system.  the system is cumbersome and very menu heavy and not intuitive.  you have to go through menu after menu when it would be better to have more things on one page and less page changing.  11th problem  you have to use the i drive button to accept terms and conditions every time you start the car if you want to use anything on the nav screen.   starting my car is a process.   i have to hit ok to the disclaimer that will pop up every time i start the car.  then wait for the tire pressure monitor warning to come on so i can clear that screen, then i have to go 5 screens into the radio menu to turn the audio from my phone back on(it doesn't work every time and sometimes i have to switch back and forth between radio and bluetooth several times for it to switch on.  then i am ready to drive.   i have timed this and it takes about 2.5 minutes on average. if you don't think this is a long time try waiting in your car for 2.5 minutes while having a someone honking at at you because he wants your parking space  12th problem--when i first got the car i could turn the car off and it would automatically put the car in park for me.   after a software upgrade from the dealer, the car will freak out if i don't place it in park before i turn the engine off.  13th problem.  when locking the door from the outside touch button, it takes about 15 seconds to actually lock.   you will have to stand with the car to make sure it locks before you walk off and i end up hitting the button about 20 times before it actually locks the doors.   there is no delay if i use the remote, but then i have to dig it out of my pocket and that defeats the purpouse of a key fob  14th problem is with the dealer in Oklahoma City.  if i have a problem, there is a week delay to bring the car in to get it worked on.  if i want the free rental car they offer, there is a 2 week delay to bring the car in for servicing.  My local lexus dealer can get  me in the same day with a rental car  15th problem.   while hey claim everyting is included in the warranty including brakes and oilchanges, they dont include alignment, which had to be done twice",3.0,"After 5 BMWs this one was my last I want to start by saying this was a lease car and i am glad it was a lease i could walk away from.  i have had 5 other BMWs before this and with this and My 650 convertible i have switched to Lexus.

 on 12/03/16 19:49 PM (PST),Frenchy ,2014 BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),BMW X3 A Jolly little toy for adults," Bought my X3 xdrive28i  3 years ago and drove it about 13 000/year. This car is a real pleasure to drive every morning to work. It takes away the boredom of the drive to work early every morning  I work about 25 miles away and my ride takes about 35 mn so I drive quite a lot. I used to dread that drive but this car made my mornings much more fun. I drive a mixed mileage on the highway and normal roads. The drive on the highway is a real breeze. I drive it on the comfort mode and the car has plenty enough of pick up to pass cars without any problems even at high speed. I am very surprised by the amount of power this little 4 cylinders has even when I go over 80 mile per hour. You can actually have a lot more pick up by switching it to the sport mode, which has great acceleration power, when you merge or want to change lanes fast.  This car is a lot of fun to drive. If you are lucky enough to live in a region with back roads, you can have a lot of fun to drive it. I live in PA and the car is great for hills and turns on tight roads. It grips the road. In one word, it drives fantastic. I took 2 trip to South Carolina with it and it drove fantastic. The interior is simple but looks great. I have the special lights on it and good God, they are amazing at night. The car also has an amazing break system that saved me a few times from hitting dear at night. The car all wheel drive is great on the snow. I used to have a Subaru Outback and I think this car is better on the snow. It comes with free maintenance for 4 years. I never paid anything until now except my inspection every year and a set of tires. Now for the negative. Not much to say the truth. The tires/wheels are the only thing I am having a problem with. In the winter, the pressure on the tires can vary quite a lot depending on the temperature. My dash board showed a few times a low pressure on the tires. I had to go to my gas station a few times in the winter to put air in my tires. I have Pirelli zero all weather run flat tires on this car and get ready to spend at least $350 to $400 per tire when you change them. They don't last long either (25 000 miles at most) but they are silent and grip the road. I guess this is the price to pay for performance tires and the security of run flat tires, but you can install normal tires that will cost a fraction of these if you prefer. The car does not have a spare wheel in case of a flat but BMW has free 24h road assistance included. Most insurances do too. My insurance went up by about $30/month when I switched from my Subaru Outback to this car too. The gas mileage is not great (21 miles at most per gallon on the highway) so I use the eco mode when I drive in the city (it does not save you much anyway). It shuts down the engine when the car stops which I like (you don't have to use this if you don't want to). The options are expensive and the price of the car can go up in a hurry. The head lights are well worth it though and I like the GPS on it once you know how to use it. The ondrive system is great (it links my I-phone 6 through bluetooth to my music and pandora automatically when you start the car without having to do anything but not to your e-mail. BMW does not allow texting and e-mailing while driving). The music system is not fantastic unless you get the upgrade (12 speakers) which is amazing and worth the money if you like to listen to music (loud and clear). That is the only regret on my car. I should have got this cause when I got into another model which had it, what a difference it was. Overall, this is a fantastic car. I have no regret about this car. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. This was the best present I ever bought myself for Christmas. Not cheap but if you have the means, you can't go wrong.My car is now out of warranty. 4.5 years old. Still nothing bad to say about it. No problems whatsoever for now. Still love this car which is pretty rare after such a period of time. No rust or other problems. Changed the brakes once (covered by warranty) and did all the oil changes prescribed. The car is still running like a Swiss watch.",4.0,"BMW X3 A Jolly little toy for adults Bought my X3 xdrive28i  3 years ago and drove it about 13 000/year.

It had 50K miles on it when we purchased it.  We now have 168K.  This one had about every option except navigation (which I didn't want anyhow), and 19"" wheels.  Ours had the 18"" wheels.  First, the ///M package is the sharpest looking of all of these X3's.  It body colors every component of the car and you don't get the black plastic around the wheel wells.  It has been a fairly reliable car, but like any highly optioned vehicle, it has stuff to break.  I will try to list everything that has been wrong or I've had to fix.  First thing to go wrong was the sub-woofer under the passenger side seat went bad.  Then the right hand door speaker followed.  The right mirror doesn't fold any more, nor does it self-dim or heat.  I assume it's a power problem.  The valve cover started leaking and the CCV diaphragm (built into the valve cover) went bad.  That requires a new valve cover to fix.  Also lost a water pump.  They are electric, so a new one installed was $900.  Next was a starter and alternator, another $grand to replace those.  The transfer case has a motor that has a gear on it; it went bad.  I saved a bundle by replacing the gear myself.  BMW doesn't carry ""just a gear"" for it, but some ingenuous person makes them and I bought one.  BMW wants $900 for a new motor.  The right hand door seal has leaked under hard rains forever.  It gets the carpet wet at times.  It's a poor design.  I had to replace the rear door vapor barrier as it too was getting the rear carpet wet.  The bolster heater on the driver's side seat burned through the leather and burned a hole my wife's nice North Face jacket.  I hear it's a common problem on BMW's that could have been disastrous.  The ambient temperature sensor hasn't read correctly since day one.  It is always off about 7 degrees.  One day the left dash side window defroster vent just popped off.  The little prong that holds it in just broke off.  The washer jug fluid motors both went bad.  They would leak all of the washer fluid out.  The pop up washers for the headlights quit working.  No loss there, I hated the things anyhow.  My wife loves the car and wants another one.  When she starts fixing it, she can have another.

I absolutely love my car. When we bought it however, the radiator was busted and it was making some kind of ticking noise. We got that fixed. We kept the car in service and I haven't wrecked or anything. The car's rear tires were worn down when we bought the car so we replaced them. We didn't know at the time that when you buy an expensive car the the front and rear tires were two different sizes. So it messed the transfer case up. When they replaced that, the towing company bent my steering rack which is now throwing off some lights and one of my O2 sensors needs to be replaced. My local BMW dealership told me that once you replace one O2 sensor that you will have to replace the others, which I found out is a lie. But I also had my oil pan replaced, (it had an oil leak when we bought it), and I wouldn't recommend taking it to a place that ""specializes"" only on foreign made cars. They charged us $2,000 to fix it. One of the parts only costed $35 and the labor was $800. Other than what all has happened, the car is an outstanding car, I honestly don't want to get rid of it.

I went to multiple dealerships, and this vehicle fit my budget, and was AWD SUV. I bought the vehicle for $9,500 with 120,000 miles. Unfortunately during the entire process, my phone was broken, so I couldn't really research much. Afterward I found out the vehicle at the time was worth a little over $6k, but I have had no buyer's remorse. It gets about 19-23 MPG, which is to be expected on a 2004 SUV. As of Feb 2017, and in Springfield Oregon, it costs me about $45 to fill up my entire gas(premium) tank. The gas tank is 17.7 gallons. The steering is very ""tight"" feeling, as opposed to other cars I've driven. This took me about an hour to adjust to how tight the steering really is, and now I will prefer tight steering going forward. This car is very comfortable, and easy to ride in. It is really spacious, and NOT cramped at all. Men over 6' have plenty of head space/leg space in the front. In the back, they have the same amount of head space, and plenty of leg space depending on who they are sitting behind.  I have almost NO blind spots. The visibility in the vehicle is incredible. I have had 1 incident with this car in Dec 16: the original 2004 starter(the starter was labeled 2004 BMW) went out. So far, no other issues, and I wouldn't really say that a 12 year old starter going out was an issue, it was time! My boyfriend and father were able to diagnose that it was the starter, and they were able to remove the old starter and install the new one for the cost of the starter at $150, from O'Reilly's. I do know, however, that it was difficult for them to do the work, and it took them several hours, as the starter is located in a hard-to-reach spot. I use 5W-30 full synthetic and have the oil/oil filter regularly changed. I use premium gas, as the manual states to do so. My particular model doesn't have a nav system, it only has the ""business stereo"" which is pretty basic, but not too shabby. There are steering wheel controls: radio/cd and cruise control. Excellent heated front seats. A full sunroof, that extends to the back seat. The back trunk isn't too large, but works well for me, and if I need to haul something that takes up more room, I just put the back row seats down. The battery is very accessible. The battery is located in the trunk area under the floor board, and there are charging posts by the battery in the trunk and under the front hood, so you can be jumped (if necessary) by front or back.  Also, the back cargo door can not be opened without the battery in or if it is completely dead. If you have to open the back door, you must climb in the back, lift the back floorboard. In the door there is a small rectangle opening in the middle. Stick a screw driver in the hole and slide it over, then the back door will pop open. My seats are leather, and have no cracking as of Feb 17. There are a few spots(high-use areas) where the leather dye has warn, but not much, and not noticeable at first glance. This car does have an auto-headlight feature, and sensor windshield wipers. The auto headlights work 100% of the time.

 on 04/18/16 21:17 PM (PDT),NCUltraRunner ,2016 BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),So far so great!," I was considering the Audi Q5, Lexus NX200t and Range Rover Evoque before deciding on the BMW X3. I was almost seduced by the Evoque, but reading all of the owner horror stories scared me away. I took delivery of my X3 in December 2015 and have already put about 7500 miles on the vehicle. Thus far, the X3 has performed flawlessly and has not disappointed! Initial build quality appears to be worthy of the price tag.I've found the xDrive system to work very well on the road during inclement weather (heavy rain, light snow), although I did not have to put it to the test in deep snow. I do not have the Dynamic Handling Package, but given how well the X3 handles the road without it, I'm not really sure how much of a difference I might notice with it. I've read other reviews where some felt the ride was too harsh, but I don't share that opinion, although I do like to feel the road perhaps more than some might. The vehicle handles and accelerates so smoothly perhaps with the exception of the auto start/stop feature which can be noticeable at times. I leave it in the ""Comfort"" drive mode most of the time. I put it in ""Sport"" mode, when merging onto a freeway or needing to get through busy intersections when I need the extra burst of acceleration. I rarely use ECO Mode. I've found the gas mileage between ECO and Comfort to be relatively negligible and the gearing is just too dulled down for my liking in ECO mode. I've been averaging just over 23 miles per gallon for which probably 75% of my miles are highway.I find the interior of the X3 to be nicely appointed and up to standards of fit and finish for the class of vehicle. I find the seating to be comfortable and the climate control system to work very well. The Infotainment system menu is fairly intuitive and with a little playing around with it, you should be able to figure out most of the functions and settings in relatively short order. The iDrive controller is easy to use to navigate the control panel, but some of the buttons on the passenger side of the controller are hard to see from the driver's seat. The one function I haven't really used much is the voice command system, so I can't really comment to how accurately it works. The buttons and controls on the dashboard and steering wheel all seem to be well placed with proper tactile feel.In my opinion, there are a few ""must"" have packages to avoid buyer's remorse:* xLine or M Sport Package: I think either of those significantly enhance the aesthetics of the vehicle. I went with the xLine. I'm happy with it, but wish the Sport Seats that you get with the M Sport package was an available option.* Lighting Package: Recommend going with either the Xenon or Full LED. Either the Xenon or LED seem to throw a much brighter light and I personally think they look much better than the yellowish Halogens. I opted for the Xenon lights and am very happy with them.* Dual-Pane Moonroof (either as standalone option or part of the Premium Package). About as close to the convertible feel as you can get.As far as the other options go, I opted the following: Premium package, Technology package, Driver Assistance package, Driver Assistance Plus, Harman Kardon Sound System and Heated Front Seats. Unfortunately, in order to get certain features, you have to opt for entire packages. For example, if you want Lumbar Support on the front seat, you have to get the Premium package. If you want the Head Up display, you have to get the Technology package. The safety features are spread out between the Driver Assistance Package and Driver Assistance Plus. If you only want rear view camera and parking sensors, you can just opt for the Driver Assistance package. However, of all the available safety features, Active Blind Spot detection was most important to me so I had to select the Driver Assistance Plus package which also requires you to select the Driver Assistance package. I've found the surround view camera feature that is part of the Driver Assistance Plus package to be very useful as well. I'm hardly an audiophile, but the HK sound system sounds good to my ears. The Heated Front seats have 3 settings and heat up quickly.There are a few features missing that I would have liked to see available on the X3:* Full size spare or at least a temporary spare. This is my biggest gripe. My X3 came with run flats. There is no hole in the cargo area for any type of spare nor under the vehicle. I've seen aftermarket temporary spares available, but unless you put it on your roof rack, you have to put it in the rear cargo area which then leaves you with little cargo room.* Cooled front seats. I have black Nevada leather and would really have liked the option to have cooled front seats for the hot weather.* Auto-Folding Side Mirrors.

With three clicks, you can turn it off, but it wonât stay off.  Every time you start the vehicle, it will come back to annoy you â first with a legal disclaimer and then an array of meaningless menu choices.  Itâs impossible to make the screen display something useful like a digital clock (a Kia will do that, but a BMW wonât).

Youâll find the FM/HD radio choice is in a different section of the menu than the CD player and Bluetooth devices.  Perhaps itâs just German humor.Info thatâs more easily accessed includes the ownerâs manual (should you be reading that on the dashboard while driving?) and contact info for the BMW complaint center (maybe BMW owners use that one a lot?).  You can also schedule a service appointment with a random BMW dealership with just a couple of clicks.

However if you need to call your spouse, plan on pulling over to the side of the road and scrolling through the alphabet, because the âfavoritesâ from your iPhone will not upload to this system and the voice-dial feature is erratic at best.I like a lot of things about my 2017 BMW â great steering and acceleration, quiet and steady ride, nice lines, quality trim everywhere.

Perhaps itâs just German humor.Info thatâs more easily accessed includes the ownerâs manual (should you be reading that on the dashboard while driving?) and contact info for the BMW complaint center (maybe BMW owners use that one a lot?).  You can also schedule a service appointment with a random BMW dealership with just a couple of clicks.  But they canât fix your menu.Want to âsearch by pictureâ and learn more about âscrew thread for tow fittingâ on this carâs front bumper?  Thatâs literally choice #3 of 12 on an image of the vehicle, just two clicks and a quarter-spin away.  But once again â is this info you should be using while the vehicleâs moving?  However if you need to call your spouse, plan on pulling over to the side of the road and scrolling through the alphabet, because the âfavoritesâ from your iPhone will not upload to this system and the voice-dial feature is erratic at best.I like a lot of things about my 2017 BMW â great steering and acceleration, quiet and steady ride, nice lines, quality trim everywhere.  But the stupid, amateur-designed, useless menu stuck in the middle of my dashboard is a daily irritation that wonât go away.

With a shocking 445 horsepower and a 4.4L V8 engine, this BMW is built for speed. In the previous models the 5 series had the available option for an auto-stop start system, which saves gas while the vehicle is at a complete stop. Standard features on the new 5 series along with the older models starting at 2011 include power trunk lid, satellite radio, navigation, and Harman Kardon sound system.  The 5 series comes with a variety of engines such as the 528i, 535i, 535d, and 550i. Some may have ""xdrive"" applied with their names, indicating it is all-wheel drive.The BMW is a four-door five passenger sedan. It is compatible with the Jaguar XF, Mercedes Benz E-class, Audi A6, Lexus GS 350, Cadillac CTS, and the Maserati Ghibli. Surprisingly, the 550i series remains the better choice over all of those vehicles. For it to be such a large sedan it goes from zero to 60 in 4.5 seconds. If you are looking for a sporty but luxury four-door sedan, the BMW 5 series is definitely a great way to go. It comes in tons of color options inside and out, along with technology package as well. For example, if you are looking for an vehicle for luxury and sport but not too big on the luxury side, the 5 series is perfect. The 5 series can switch from comfort also known as luxury to sport by the push of one button. You will not go wrong if you choose this vehicle. Pros of the 550i includes, Superb engines with impressive fuel economy in most forms; high-quality interior that's packed with high-tech features; comfortable and composed ride. Cons includes, Ho-hum handling; relatively small trunk; intrusive auto stop-start system. Some safety features range from stability and traction control, anti-lock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and active front head restraints. The braking system also periodically wipes the brake rotors dry in wet conditions and automatically snugs the brake pads to the rotors in preparation when you abruptly lift off the throttle. Another standard feature is the BMW Assist and Remote Services emergency communications systems, which include automatic crash notification, an SOS button, remote door unlock and stolen vehicle recovery.Parking sensors and a rear-view camera are standard on the 550i and optional on other models. An upgraded side- and top-view parking camera system is optional.

My other two cars are a 2014 Prius Sedan and a 2014 Prius V. I have owned GM's, Fords, Cadillac's, Jeeps, but for some reason I like diesel engines better. The first BMW,  I absolutely fell in love with that car. I got 40mpg in town and 45 to 46 mpg on the highway. The car was so good, I wanted bigger, and decided to buy the 2016 BMW 535 diesel with the 6 cylinder engine. BMW did not skimp on quality or luxury with this car. I have never had any maintenance problem with BMW's, I keep my cars properly serviced and inspection clean. I get better mileage then what BMW says on their sticker, because, just like a Prius, you have to learn HOW to properly drive one.  Some pro drivers don't like the cut off feature when the vehicle is stopped, and restart, but it never bothered me. It's a fuel saver. BMW diesel engines make very little noise. They are a pleasure to drive, and the car remains tight and noise free. The technical features are numerous but only add to the enjoyment of the vehicle. Just take a test drive in either the gas or diesel and you will see what I'm talking about.  Note: I wrote this review last year at age 72. My opinion remains the same. Only the millage has changed.UPDATE April 29, 2017:  My review of this car remains unchanged. In fact, I usually trade cars about every three years, but am considering just keeping this one. I keep the car garaged, had opti guard put on it when new, use a leather conditioner that is used on Rolls Royce cars, and keep the car in show room condition. The ride is still great and long drives are relaxing, comfortable and the six cylinder is plenty of power. Plus as I keep saying, a diesel engine will perform under the worst conditions and abuse. My dealership has an outstanding service department that checks on me now and then to see if everything ok or if I need any service. My other BMW is a 2016, 228i coupe 4 cyl turbo that is another great car.UPDATE November 1, 2017:  Mr review of this car remains unchanged.

My car has all of the packages (sports, cold weather, premium) that were available at time of purchase. OMG! What a fun car to drive! This car is the best compromise between sport/luxury, power/economy, and it is oozing with class. Due to exceptional handling, my confidence on the road under any driving conditions is extremely high. Other than a six-figure sports car, my 530i can handle any driving maneuver better than other vehicles due to the Sport Package suspension system. The cab is quiet. The car is heavy as a tank yet rides like a gazelle. I feel very safe in my vehicle. Owners have made the mistake of filling the coolant system expansion tank to the top. You are suppose to only fill it until the float is level with the the top. This leaves about 1/3 air inside the expansion tank. As the coolant heats up and ""expands"", it overflows into the expansion tank. When it cools down and contracts, it brings the level back down. By overfilling the expansion tank, excessive coolant pressure builds as it expands. This eventually caused the expansion tank and/or the radiator to rupture (via a hairline crack). Then the very people who have overfilled the tank go into BMW forums and complain about the coolant system being cheap rather than realize that overfilling it caused the problem. The same is true of the transmission fluid. BMW basically lied and claimed their transmission fluid lasts forever and does not need to be changed. This sometimes results in a torque converter going bad somewhere between 100,000 ~ 200,000 miles. If you ignore BMW and change the ATF every 30,000 ~ 60,000 miles, this too would not be an issue.BMW handles so great because they figured out decades ago, if you achieve even weight distribution be tween the front and rear axle, the center of gravity will be as perfect as it can be, which makes the car hug the road much better under any condition. To achieve a 50/50% f/r weight distribution, BMW used light-weight parts under the hood, and even placed the battery in the trunk on the passenger side (opposite corner from the driver). Due to the slightly larger 530i engine (compared to the 528), my car weigh distribution is 51/49% f/r.

This care is ridiculously fast.  My daily commute averages between 80 and 100 mph, and it completely capable at these speeds.  It has the best brakes I've ever felt in a car.  You stomp on the pedals and they bring all 4,000 pounds to a quick stop.  The active anti-roll bars and active steering are a must for enthusiast driving--do not buy this car without these.    However, there is a bit of ""play"" in the throttle pedal, about a quarter press before I get a response.  This is somewhat annoying when rounding a slow corner and trying to throttle out of it--I have to depress the pedal while still turning the corner.    COMFORT: 4 Stars.  The seats could be better.  I slide around a bit too much on fast corners, and can't quite get the lumbar in the right position on my back.  Also, the steering wheel tilt needs a little more motion--I draw it all the way out and all the way down and still need more.  With the windows up, the cabin is very quiet.  However with the windows down, for some reason I get an unusual amount of wind blowing from outside into the cabin and at my face--way more than any other car.  Because of this I just can't cruise at high speed with the windows down.  INTERIOR: 5 stars.  The trunk fits my golf clubs AND a stroller.  The instrumentation, logic & controls are all very intuitive and in the right place.  I think the cupholders are a marvelous innovation--high up and out of the way of your shifting, and can be tucked away when not in use.  However, the sunroof glass rattles when closed.  TECHNOLOGY: 5 stars.  If you can't figure out iDrive after a week of use, you have problems.  After learning it and getting used to control everything with my hand down at my side, I can't stand driving cars that require me to lift my hand up to the dash to press a button--that's how good this is.  I already spoke to the driving technology but they deserve another mention: active sway bars & active steering are simply amazing marvels.  This car is ten years old and STILL ahead of its time.  Bluetooth is very basic.  Forget the voice commands.  I use Siri to make my calls.  But once the call is made, the connection is crystal clear even at 100mph.  Like my title says: I handle business all over town feeling like Ari Gold in this car ;)  RELIABILITY: 4 stars.  No major drivetrain components failed.  However my central Nav computer broke, shutting down all audio, iDrive, navigation, etc.  This was a $1,200 fix.  Also my trunk release button (on the trunk) stopped working, but I can still open it with the button in the cabin or the key fob.  Little things.  It DOES burn about a quart of oil every month, but the iDrive is very good at letting me know when to top it off.  I do all oil & filter changes by hand in under an hour.  VALUE: 4 Stars.  Its amazing how cheap you can buy these cars for, and they have more features and better performance than brand new $30,000 sedans.  MPG is very low: 13 city, 17 highway.

 on 08/19/15 10:47 AM (PDT),Lawrence Katzenstein ,2006 BMW 5 Series Sedan 530i 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6M),Great looking car with performance that matches," I bought this car three years ago and I've generally been quite satisfied. It gets decent mileage overall and over 30mpg on the road. New passengers not aware of the brand will often ask what kind of car it is because it's so comfortable. Since the car has had very little wear its frequently confused with a newer car since the basic body design remained the same until 2010.It does have some flaws. One of these is that the I-Drive computer occasionally doesn't boot at start up and leaves me without a radio until it does. The parking radar often takes a while to shut off after leaving a parking space. However in the basics like comfort and performance the car is great. I did purchase an extended drive train warranty, but I've recently had a large number of systems fail in short order including the water pump, purge valve, and transmission pan and filter. There's also the standard German oil leak which is so minuscule that I've chosen not to fix it. My mechanic and I both think that this bad period will pass and that the car will remain reliable so I'm currently still positive about it. It's a great machine.Addendum: On the positive side I've just been in an accident where I was broadsided by  a driver who didn't try to stop. He must have  been doing at least 65 in a 45 speed limit zone. The car lost a fender and deployed the side but not front airbags. I lost one fender and little else. I walked away without a scratch. Very impressive! The only negative about this car and other BMWs is that some systems are unique so it's hard to find a mechanic who will work on one other than the dealer.

The first two were pretty reliable although on one I had to have one of the injector port replaced.  In January of 2018 I leased the third, an M550i Xdrive.  It's nice looking, is pretty quick and it's fun to drive.  I took possession in the winter and around April I noticed the AC didn't cool...just blew hot air.  I took it in to the dealer who charged up the system and kept it for a week looking for leaks.  Didn't find any.  Car was returned and enjoyed great AC until late June.  Just today (June 24th) the AC went from cold air to cool and finally warm in less than an hour.  Now I have to make a long hot drive to bring the car back in to the dealer next week.  I get a loaner but it's an inferior model (except for the AC).  I've only had the car for 180 days but I'm already half way to officially being able to declare the vehicle a Lemon under Texas law.  Two other annoying things are the music connection and the wireless charging.  For music I mostly use Pandora through my iPhone X.  The connection to the car is unreliable and I generally have to restart my phone to get it to play.  I've used both the BMW app and Apple Car Play.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the $300 Car Play option.  The wireless charger is hit and miss as well.  I've used two phones that are Qi charger capable and both sometimes work in the car and sometimes don't.  They both charge perfectly on the wireless charger at home.   In summary the car drives well, but the AC and the electronics problems make the car a poor choice if you're a driver who wants his $90,000 car to work as advertised.

This is my first BMW and I must say I love this car.The car has an excellent combination of a comfortable ride and good handling.  The handling is not as sharp as the older style BMW 3 series, but its good for driving around town and maybe taking a corner or two at higher speeds.  The snow traction with the AWD is awesome.The Navigation system is the best I have ever seen.  Everything makes perfect sense and it works extremely well.  I love the fact that I can write letters with my fingers on the touch pad and it recognized them.  The navigation interface is the best of any cars I have owned by far.The Bluetooth menu takes a little getting used to but once you get used to it, it is easy to use.  It locks to my Android phone very quickly and phone conversations are clear via Bluetooth. Put the car in Eco mode and it is a pussycat just minding its own business and getting you from point A to point B in style.  Switch it to Sport mode and the car turns into a little monster pinning you back into your seat as you step on the accelerator.I have the premium package with Navigation and the winter package.  My kids love the heated rear seats in NE winter.The interior of this car is in need of an update to keep up with the new Audi and Mercedes interior.  But it is perfectly functional and looks good.  I wish that the climate control would remember the last fan settings and would not always start in the same mode.  I have to change the fan setting every time I turn the engine on.  The mileage for around town driving is in the low 20s, but highway is above 30 in Eco mode and if you keep your speeds around 60 MPH.  It is hard to drive 60 MPH on the highway with this car though as it is so smooth and quiet even at 90 MPH.I have not had a single mechanical or electrical problem with the car that required repairs.  It is under bumper to bumper warranty for 4 years of 40K miles.  It also includes free maintenance in that duration.  The Audi only provides free maintenance for 1 yr or 10K miles.I have owned Hondas and Toyotas prior to this BMW.

 on 01/18/16 13:57 PM (PST),Wilson ,2014 BMW 3 Series Wagon 328i xDrive 4dr Wagon AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Sportwagon - Child Seat Comments included!," I spent the better part of a frigid New England (just snowed) morning test driving two cars 1) a 2014 BMW 328xi wagon with luxury package and 2) a new 2015 BMW 328xd wagon with nav and a couple of the basic packages. I had never driven a diesel before so I felt I owed it to myself to try these two head-to-head. While the diesel had a broadly useable torque band, I felt it lacked uphill oomph especially in the 2nd or 3rd gear range (tough to tell because the transmission shifts so smoothly in both models). Granted this was a 25 degree day and we basically started it cold from the dealership, but after having driven a similarly cold gasoline model over the same roads earlier in the morning, the diesel just didnât compare. In my opinion, the diesel was overpriced even with the 2015 âleftoverâ discount, about $7k more than the lightly used 2014 with 10k miles. The diesel exhaust note, as many reviews have noted, is coarse and loud at revs. The gasoline exhaust note is fake, pumped in through the sound system. You can actually hear it change its volume if you switch from Comfort to Sport under hard acceleration. Still, I prefer a quiet car with some audio theatrics to one that sounds like an economy car with gravel under the hood.Now for some comments that pertain to both models:1)	Very few reviews ever cover the fit and functionality of child seats. The local used car dealership graciously allowed me to mess around with different configurations after I test drove it. I am 6â0 and need to use a fair amount of front seat track to get comfortable behind the wheel. In the rear-facing position, I found the child seat to be workable, but it took a fair amount of finagling. Both test cars were equipped with power front seats rather than the manual kind found in some of the base models. For 6â0+ drivers, you might have to live with your seatback a little more upright than youâre used to in order to get the child seat to fit correctly in the rear-facing position. I also found it helped to drop the driverâs seat almost to the floor. In the front-facing position, there were no problems at all.Now, I didnât try one of our newer child seats â a Britax G3 Marathon. Those stay in my wifeâs minivan since she does 90% of the child transportation. They are a bit more bulky, mostly laterally, than the regular G3 because they have the extra head protection. With BMWâs new 40-20-40 folding seatbacks, you might be able to utilize your â20â with two regular G3s in the back, but youâd have a much harder time doing the same thing with the wider G3 Marathons.2)	The stock stereo system is middling. Not sure the upgrade would necessarily be worth it, but it could be worth considering.3)	Despite some criticism of the new suspension, I found the Sport mode in both models to be amply stiff for hard corners in slippery conditions. Yes, I did try a couple after dropping off my sales minder at the front door.4)	Visibility out the back is limited and the side mirrors are tiny. Unfortunately, this means springing for blind-spot detection is a must.5)	After half an hour in the standard seats, I wasnât loving them. The seat bottoms are totally flat with just average padding. They reminded me of the mid-90s Subaru Outback wagon seats. Both my testers had lumbar support, which even for me as a relatively healthy mid-30s guy is a must. I would probably limit my search to models with the sport seats from here out.6)	The new touch-sensitive controller is little too sensitive for the initiated, but I found myself accidentally clicking stuff when I was trying to use the jogger control.7)	Overall, I donât think either of these models is worth the near $50k price tag, but finding a lightly used CPO at <$40k seems right for the gasoline-powered model. The diesel model really doesnât warrant a premium, but my commutes most days are fairly short so Iâm probably not the target market for it.",4.0,"Sportwagon - Child Seat Comments included!

I didn't replace them because they were just starting to go bad and they said they'd probably last another 10k. I soon started to smell an awful oil smell and it was from the gasket leaking in the oil filter housing ($400) Right after that, the cross (under) pipe for the coolant system got a crack in it ($228) and I had to have it towed back to the mechanic ($98). At 140K the car picked up an annoying surge and I knew that I had a misfire.

 on 08/22/16 21:12 PM (PDT),Michael ,2016 BMW 3 Series Sedan 340i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),"Great performance, but very expensive."," After several months of researching all types of different vehicles I ultimately decided on purchasing the 2016 340i xDrive. Overall, this vehicle met my needs and after reading countless reviews (consumer and professional) the 340i remained in my top three narrowed down selection. My personal needs for a vehicle required performance, luxury, AWD (due to the snowy winters in Chicago), and decent gas mileage (sub par mpg with my last vehicle, 2012 Dodge Charger SRT8). My 340i is equipped with the cold weather package ($800), driver assistance package ($950), M sport package ($2,600), technology package ($2,750), and the track handling package ($1,700). $8,800 for those added options is very steep in my opinion but after getting a good trade-in value along with very low APR financing, as well as a tax credit and 4 years free maintenance I felt that it all balanced out. As for my impression of the vehicle, let me start off with the interior. Although many people tend to favor the interiors of Cadillac, Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, etc...the BMW interior is still very nice and luxurious. I can understand if some people think it's beginning to appear a bit dated, but nonetheless it's still superior to many vehicles on the market. The Dakota leather sport seats are top notch quality and for the most part above average in terms of comfort. The anthracite headliner, aluminum and gloss black trim accents throughout the vehicle along with the ambient lighting (which is dimmable) all go together fairly nicely. The cabin is really quiet and there are no rattle like noises or unwanted vibrations. The exterior of the vehicle is the best looking to date for the 3 series sedan in my opinion. From the elegant lines on the hood and the minor refresh of the whole body in general gives the vehicle a great sporty look that is very tasteful but not overstated or too flashy. I opted for the black sapphire metallic paint and the 19"" alloy orbit grey M sport wheels along with black kidney grilles complete the overall look. Now on to the performance. Let me tell you, this car can move and it is fast! It doesn't exactly give you the ""throw you back in your seat"" kind of feeling and I must admit I do miss that and all the rear wheel glory and torque of my previous SRT8, but I still experience an ultimate thrill and satisfaction while driving this car. The 8 speed automatic transmission is flawless. The AWD has a tenacious grip on the road and you feel like you have complete control at all times. I prefer to drive in the sport mode setting regularly as it is always responsive and ready to accelerate hard at any time. The start/stop fuel saver system is very intrusive and can be deactivated with a push of a button and I never use it. I have a lead foot and most of my driving is in the city and I'm averaging 16 mpg which for me is acceptable especially considering the performance you get with the 3.0 liter twin turbo V-6. I've read that 0-60 mph can be as low as 4.4 seconds which I don't doubt depending on the conditions and where you live of course. The adaptive M suspension is great, but comfort does suffer a bit if you're selecting the sport modes. The low profile run flat tires detract from the comfort too, but nothing that isn't tolerable. The handling on this car is great too. So much that it almost feels like you're driving a coupe. Although this is a sedan, it feels so light and steering it is so effortless without taking away from the overall driving experience. The M sport brakes are phenomenal and feel perfect and smooth (not too sensitive and not too soft) when I need to apply my foot to the pedal. I also really like the sound of the dual exhaust when I drive in sport mode. You'll definitely hear the ""crackles and pops"" when revving the engine and when you accelerate hard and ease off the gas pedal. I always look forward to getting behind the wheel of this car and just letting it open up on the road. But let me tell you, this car isn't perfect. I do have a few gripes with it. Mostly with the knob control of the display screen. It can get quite annoying. Turn the knob to scroll here, click this and click that, hit the back button to exit, and on and on. So many times I want to be able to just touch the screen and get to what I want with ease but I can't. I knew this beforehand of course and was willing to deal with it. Connecting your iPod or iPhone via Bluetooth or with a cable isn't the best in terms of integration with this vehicle either. The interface definitely needs some tweeking. For example, let's say you connect your phone via Bluetooth so you can play your music. Accessing playlists or trying to shuffle songs is not easy when dealing with the knob turn dial control. And with the lack of a touch screen, you can't just select what you want with ease. If you've had a Nissan/Infiniti or a Dodge, their infotainment systems are much better.

 on 03/08/16 16:21 PM (PST),Whoever ,2016 BMW 3 Series Sedan 340i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Competing with pro review on 340ix," I thought it might be useful for someone to get a more detailed review of this car based on personal experience of owning it and at the same time comparing it with other cars owed or tested. When somebody tells me 'I love my car, its great' it generally tells me very little. I heard that from the owners of KIA or Prius or Tahoe and other cars that I personally would try to avoid. They all have something good about them (if only the price) and are better than any car produced in India, for example, but that does not tell me exactly how these cars are  really better or worse than others. And that's the only thing that really matters, for me at least. So here it goes.I bought my new 340ix aboumonths ago and have about 1500miles on it now. Before that I owned for 3.5 years 335is coupe, before that Mercedes 320 Sport Edition and my wife owns (so me too to a degree) new Z4 35i and before that z4 35 sport and before that z3. Before getting into 340ix, while thinking of either re-leasing or replacing my 335is I tried BMW 435i, M325, 335i, M3, Mercedes c450amg, Audi4 and 5 and RS, Hyundai Genesis and that are all the cars (not to mention my experiences with rental Toyotas, VW, Chevrolet, Nissan and bunch of others) that I can compare. First, none of the tried cars were worth switching to from my 335is. With exception of M3. Which would go beyond what I was willing to pay. So finally arriving of the new 340ix did it. It matched engine power with 335is, it had x drive which I found attractive (335is was not fun driving around ski resorts), it had a couple of luxury items I'd like to have and it was a new car I could have for almost the same lease money. So what did I get? Considering I paid for M package, Track package, Park assist and ignored Navigation altogether. Actually, not one but four cars with very distinct personalities. Consequence of track and M packages that provide several different modes of driving which are really something very noticeable, not just on paper statements. On other cars I tried and on my wife's Z4 those are also present, nothing new, but while you can feel the difference on other cars I feel its rather much more dramatic on 340ix. So, starting with these modes:First, they indeed can be useful and I do switch between them in different conditions. Second, I cant say I'm particularly happy about them. I would be perfectly fine with one perfectly tuned suspension and steering. Which was the case in my 2012 335iS, frankly having the ideally  tuned suspension and steering, better than any other car I tried so far (better even than in M3 and maybe better than Porsche Boxter). I don't know how they managed that but they did with 335is - exceptionally smooth, absorbing all the major road imperfection and at the same time razor sharp with just heavy enough and firm steering to feel the road and keep things under absolute control. Simply a joy to drive. Why BMW would not just stick with it?? People just keep saying that new BMW cars generation lost this handling edge but BMW stubbornly ignores that. And these modes are:1. ECO Pro - it could be even Eco Pro Pro or super pro or whatever else BMW marketing call them there would still be nothing 'Pro' here. This mode turns your BMW into Toyota Primus. It reduces the engine response to the gas pedal and add a bunch of indicators on display to let you sort of play some computer game, giving some saved miles bonuses, plots and tips, etc. Warning if you press too hard on accelerator pedal or exceed some speed limits. I played around with it while breaking in the car but frankly I can't see what an idiot (pardon) would buy BMW to drive it in Eco mode. 2. Comfort mode - that mode is actually better than on 335 or Z4. It feels a little firmer and more steerable. But still not what I would consider providing a good BMW-like driving experience. It provides reasonable engine output (press the pedal and you really go) and its smooth but IMHO a little bobbing on bumps and the steering is just too overpowered and soft which makes you a little nervous on high speeds. I still use it in rush hour and maybe its OK to use on gravel roads or something. But its still nowhere close to the standard 335is experience, worse than Z4 comfort mode and I would even prefer Mercedes 320Sport driving to that. It reminds me Buick leSabre on steroids. The worst part of it - its a default mode. You cant change it. Why??? Both Audi and Mercedes let you choose whats default, its all software. Mercedes even let you customize the parameters of the mode to choose your preferences. Why am I forced to drive in comfort mode the car most would buy for sporty behavior? That's plain stupid. Its the same on Z4.  So if you bought the car not to show that you can buy luxury car but to indeed enjoy performance ride then you need not to forget to hit the mode button every time you start engine. That will give you a Sport mode. 3. Sport mode increases the responsiveness of the engine,",5.0,"Competing with pro review on 340ix I thought it might be useful for someone to get a more detailed review of this car based on personal experience of owning it and at the same time comparing it with other cars owed or tested.

Which was the case in my 2012 335iS, frankly having the ideally  tuned suspension and steering, better than any other car I tried so far (better even than in M3 and maybe better than Porsche Boxter). I don't know how they managed that but they did with 335is - exceptionally smooth, absorbing all the major road imperfection and at the same time razor sharp with just heavy enough and firm steering to feel the road and keep things under absolute control. Simply a joy to drive. Why BMW would not just stick with it?? People just keep saying that new BMW cars generation lost this handling edge but BMW stubbornly ignores that. And these modes are:1. ECO Pro - it could be even Eco Pro Pro or super pro or whatever else BMW marketing call them there would still be nothing 'Pro' here. This mode turns your BMW into Toyota Primus. It reduces the engine response to the gas pedal and add a bunch of indicators on display to let you sort of play some computer game, giving some saved miles bonuses, plots and tips, etc. Warning if you press too hard on accelerator pedal or exceed some speed limits. I played around with it while breaking in the car but frankly I can't see what an idiot (pardon) would buy BMW to drive it in Eco mode. 2. Comfort mode - that mode is actually better than on 335 or Z4. It feels a little firmer and more steerable. But still not what I would consider providing a good BMW-like driving experience. It provides reasonable engine output (press the pedal and you really go) and its smooth but IMHO a little bobbing on bumps and the steering is just too overpowered and soft which makes you a little nervous on high speeds. I still use it in rush hour and maybe its OK to use on gravel roads or something. But its still nowhere close to the standard 335is experience, worse than Z4 comfort mode and I would even prefer Mercedes 320Sport driving to that. It reminds me Buick leSabre on steroids. The worst part of it - its a default mode. You cant change it. Why??? Both Audi and Mercedes let you choose whats default, its all software. Mercedes even let you customize the parameters of the mode to choose your preferences. Why am I forced to drive in comfort mode the car most would buy for sporty behavior? That's plain stupid. Its the same on Z4.  So if you bought the car not to show that you can buy luxury car but to indeed enjoy performance ride then you need not to forget to hit the mode button every time you start engine. That will give you a Sport mode. 3. Sport mode increases the responsiveness of the engine,","[('M package', 'package'), ('Track package', 'package'), ('Park assist', 'assist'), ('BMW marketing', 'marketing'), ('marketing call', 'call'), ('accelerator pedal', 'pedal'), ('speed limits', 'limits'), ('Comfort mode', 'mode'), ('engine output', 'output'), ('Z4 mode', 'mode'), ('comfort mode', 'mode'), ('default mode', 'mode'), ('s default', 'default'), ('Sport mode', 'mode')]","['really go', 'too overpowered', 'standard experience', '335is experience', 'even prefer', 'only thing', 'ignored altogether', 'So goes', 'even let', 'high speeds', 'press hard', 'reasonable engine output', 'worst part', 'really matters', 'So get']","[['car', 'one', 'test'], ['car', 'love', 'great'], ['car'], ['good', 'car'], ['nt', 'miles', 'bought', 'now', 'new'], ['year', 'new', 'wife', 'sport'], ['nt', 'car', 'think'], ['car', 'one'], ['new'], ['drive', 'like', 'car', 'one', 'new', 'ski'], ['car', 'one'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'car', 'new', 'wife'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['one'], ['car'], ['nt', 'road'], ['drive'], ['car', 'new'], ['nt'], ['miles', 'etc'], ['drive', 'car'], ['like', 'good'], ['road'], ['nt'], ['drive', 'car', 'sport'], ['bought', 'car'], ['give']]","[('340ix aboumonths', 'aboumonths'), ('Z4 35i', '35i'), ('engine power', 'power'), ('ski resorts', 'resorts'), ('luxury items', 'items'), ('lease money', 'money'), ('M packages', 'packages'), ('paper statements', 'statements'), ('al present', 'present'), ('road imperfection', 'imperfection'), ('BMW cars', 'cars'), ('cars generation', 'generation'), ('handling edge', 'edge'), ('engine response', 'response'), ('gas pedal', 'pedal'), ('computer game', 'game'), ('miles bonuses', 'bonuses'), ('Eco mode', 'mode'), ('driving experience', 'experience'), ('rush hour', 'hour'), ('gravel roads', 'roads'), ('comfort mode', 'mode'), ('luxury car', 'car'), ('performance ride', 'ride'), ('mode button', 'button'), ('Sport mode', 'mode')]","['So need', 'personal driving experience', 'several Eco comfort Sport modes', 'very distinct personalities', '3Z4 35is coupe', 'indeed enjoy', 'sporty behavior', 'new Z4 35i', 'different conditions', 'still use', 'same lease money', 'frankly having', 'new 340ix aboumonths', 'detailed review', 'have now', 'most buy', 'distinct personalities', 'different Eco comfort Sport modes', 'same time', 'finally arriving', 'major road imperfection', 'So arriving', 'perfectly tuned', 'of play', 'more detailed review', 'still consider', 'enough steering', 'new luxury cars generation', 'pro review', 'other BMW luxury cars', 'stubbornly ignores', 'tried far', 'bought ago', 'then need', 'new luxury car', 'generally tells', 'tried better', 'absolute control', 'personally try', 'other luxury car', 'ideally tuned']",neg

I found a  very nice one owner 328XI with 60k on the clock. I had the car one week before the troubles started. The car decided to Randomly start, Hot ,Cold it didn't matter. Took the car to a certified BMW repair facility and was told it was a fuel pump, and or possibly fuel relay. Cost $1500 to  replace both components. I declined bought both parts offline and put them in ($300). Problem was it didn't fix the car so back on the wrecker it went. (Did I mention Car spends lots of time on a wrecker). New shop new diagnosis, bad DMI Board. The DMI board fixed the problem. Nothing on these cars are cheap to fix, this repair with reprogramming was $1300.00. All was good for about 2 weeks and the car literally quit running at 50 MPH  (no power steering -no brakes to speak of)  Again on the wrecker it went. Diagnosis bad battery and programming issues. Ok, a Battery no big deal $240 for the battery $100.00 to program it (No, you can't just swap batteries in newer BMWs ) and of course $100 to put battery in (Labor) so  roughly $450.00 for a new battery. All was good for about 3 months. The car was excellent in the snow a pleasure to drive. performance unequaled to anything else I've owned.  Gas mileage is excellent fora performance car. I'm thinking finally got the bugs out of it,really enjoying it AND BAM total shutdown AGAIN at 45 MPH. On the wrecker again 3rd time in less than 7months. Diagnosis the computer decided it didn't want to talk to the car. To fix the car needs to be completely reprogrammed another $500 with towing. The repair shop did tell me though BMW is aware of cars losing communication with the ECU. (service Bulletin) They seem to be aware of a lot of the problems their  cars have. They like the word ""service bulletin"" basically we have a problem(s) with such and such, but you will have to pay to have it fixed. Recalls? this car has 3-- one major that could result in a fire (Heater Motor) I guess it will burn as BMW in my area has no parts to fix recall, unknown when they will receive them.  These stories are all over the web like mine. Remember this is a 60k one owner car that is about as reliable as a watch with a dead battery. Sad that in my opinion they have ""trashed their reputation with sub standard  un reliable cars .

I found a  very nice one owner 328XI with 60k on the clock. I had the car one week before the troubles started. The car decided to Randomly start, Hot ,Cold it didn't matter. Took the car to a certified BMW repair facility and was told it was a fuel pump, and or possibly fuel relay. Cost $1500 to  replace both components. I declined bought both parts offline and put them in ($300). Problem was it didn't fix the car so back on the wrecker it went. (Did I mention Car spends lots of time on a wrecker). New shop new diagnosis, bad DMI Board. The DMI board fixed the problem. Nothing on these cars are cheap to fix, this repair with reprogramming was $1300.00. All was good for about 2 weeks and the car literally quit running at 50 MPH  (no power steering -no brakes to speak of)  Again on the wrecker it went. Diagnosis bad battery and programming issues. Ok, a Battery no big deal $240 for the battery $100.00 to program it (No, you can't just swap batteries in newer BMWs ) and of course $100 to put battery in (Labor) so  roughly $450.00 for a new battery. All was good for about 3 months. The car was excellent in the snow a pleasure to drive. performance unequaled to anything else I've owned.  Gas mileage is excellent fora performance car. I'm thinking finally got the bugs out of it,really enjoying it AND BAM total shutdown AGAIN at 45 MPH. On the wrecker again 3rd time in less than 7months. Diagnosis the computer decided it didn't want to talk to the car. To fix the car needs to be completely reprogrammed another $500 with towing. The repair shop did tell me though BMW is aware of cars losing communication with the ECU. (service Bulletin) They seem to be aware of a lot of the problems their  cars have. They like the word ""service bulletin"" basically we have a problem(s) with such and such, but you will have to pay to have it fixed. Recalls? this car has 3-- one major that could result in a fire (Heater Motor) I guess it will burn as BMW in my area has no parts to fix recall, unknown when they will receive them.  These stories are all over the web like mine. Remember this is a 60k one owner car that is about as reliable as a watch with a dead battery.

 on 01/30/17 13:55 PM (PST),Len D ,2008 BMW 3 Series Sedan 335xi 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6M),"High maintenance, but high satisfaction too!"," Bought my '08 about sixteen months ago (May 2015). It was pristine with only 38k miles on it then and still runs and looks like new today, now having almost 47k miles on the odometer. It has Cold Weather, Premium and Sports packages, 6-spd manual. The run-flats were ditched by the previous owner and despite the extra weight over the nose from AWD it carves corners like a Ginsu knife with quick, responsive steering; highly tossable. Yet it also has that legendary combination of sporty handling with ride comfort, although being the 3-series it does tend to follow road perturbations more than it absorbs them, making the ride along PA's crappy roads 'busier' than I'd like at times. The car has that classic German horsepower swell where, the further along the tach the needle goes, the harder it seems to pull; third gear it's nearly frighteningly quick and I swear it has way more than 'just' 300 hp. 	All that said, I keep my fingers crossed every time I get in it. Three months after getting it, it stranded me; I had to have its third high-pressure fuel pump installed at under 40k miles. Thankfully, BMW had years before acknowledged the problem and extended the warranty on that specific part to ten years or 120k miles, which means Iâm on my own in another fifteen months. Still, warranty or not, three fuel pumps in under 40k miles is a joke. And then there are the dainty little piezo fuel injectors that also reputedly might have a short life and the twin turbo wate-gates and of course, the self-imploding water pump (every 55k miles!). The tech at my local BMW dealer, as well as the owner of the indie BMW shop I take it to, both tell me that the N54 in-line 6 is â..the best engine BMW ever made..â and that its foibles are grossly exaggerated on the internet. The dealer tech was able to tell through the BMW database that my specific car had â..already had the injectors addressed..â at around 20k miles although he was unable to explain exactly what that meant, and so he assured me I was â..good to go..â. I hope theyâre both right.	But even if they are, that still leaves me with the frequent and expensive maintenance charges. I spread-sheeted the planned expenditures according to my much-trusted indie shopâs schedule for the car, (which BTW includes changing differential and xfer case oil that BMW claims never needs changing; yeah, right!). Including the guaranteed-to-fail water-pump, itâs going to cost me about $1,000/yr to keep her maintained and running âlike a BMWâ. The online BMW forums dismiss this as â..pay-to-play..â and the cost of âbeing in the clubâ. I suppose thatâs really not so bad, but if the other of its notorious bits start to âpopâ itâll be a LOT worse than that. Frankly Iâm shopping for something less fussy to maintain and repair, while keeping my fingers crossed. The problem is, once youâve become spoiled by the carâs unparalleled combination of power, handling and comfort (for a 4-door sedan anyway), most every other sedan feels inferior by comparison. Darn Germans!!UPDATE 8/1/2017So as predicted, the car has cost me about $1,200 each year to 'maintain'. Maybe in 2017 that's not so bad?...$100/month? It still gripes me. I'm just over 49k miles now and the dreaded $1,200 water pump 'guaranteed failure' is within the next 10k miles, and possibly the 'walnut blast' to blow the carbon deposits off the valves abused by the direct injection system. But the car itself? Wow. No complaints with how it drives, the engne's power and smoothness. Like I said before, road perturbations throw it around more than I like but it does handle crisply, like a good BMW should. Bluetooth still sucks. Lately the car has taken to deciding on its own whether or not it's in a good enough mood to 'pair' with my phone when I get in the car. When it works it's fine, when it works. Infiniti had this perfected in 2007. What's up with this BMW?      I'm not sure I'm going to keep it. The primary thing keeping me in the car right now is its very low miles and 'like new' condition, and also the fact that stickshifts are getting harder and harder to find. But not impossible, so I'm leaning in the direction of parting ways. My wife's '05 Audi S4 has actually required less maintenance than this thing craves. If you absolutely must have the blue and white rounded in your driveway, this vintage of BMW will not disappoint, and so long as you're prepared to dump that kind of money into it on a yearly basis, go find one and have fun.

After years of wanting one, I was finally able to when my grandfather was finally selling his (black 325i sedan with 111k miles) after buying a newer 3 series.  For $2,500, he gave me a great deal because he kept it in great condition.  After purchasing it in August 2016, I took it down to college (400 miles away).  Even though it has a firmer ride than my former '01 accord, the ride is still comfortable on long journeys.  (If one finds the ride uncomfortable on long trips, take the back roads route  and forget about comfort when you have a big smile on your face from discovering the sublime road handling on twisty unknown turns, away from zoned out interstate cruise-controlled journeys.)                                                                                                                                                Mileage: Decent for a 6-cyl  (I avg. 450 hwy miles on 1 tank) Under avg. for city driving (My lead foot doesn't help)                                                                                              The Bad: The wave of random component break-downs began in sept 2016, having to replace the alternator.  Before driving back home for winter break in dec., the driver door window is stuck down.  I cover it with plastic and drive 400 miles.  Then during winter break (Dec-Jan), I went ahead and replaced the window motor and regulator myself. THEN, 2 days later, the rear passenger window regulator fails.  I repair and replace it myself again.  AND THEN, the 3 month old alternator takes a crap went ahead and replaced it myself again..(Being somewhat mechanically knowledgeable, I figured i could save a lot of money on repairs a shop would charge) As of now, July2017, it is sitting at the mechanic.

After years of wanting one, I was finally able to when my grandfather was finally selling his (black 325i sedan with 111k miles) after buying a newer 3 series.  For $2,500, he gave me a great deal because he kept it in great condition.  After purchasing it in August 2016, I took it down to college (400 miles away).  Even though it has a firmer ride than my former '01 accord, the ride is still comfortable on long journeys.  (If one finds the ride uncomfortable on long trips, take the back roads route  and forget about comfort when you have a big smile on your face from discovering the sublime road handling on twisty unknown turns, away from zoned out interstate cruise-controlled journeys.)

Before driving back home for winter break in dec., the driver door window is stuck down.  I cover it with plastic and drive 400 miles.  Then during winter break (Dec-Jan), I went ahead and replaced the window motor and regulator myself. THEN, 2 days later, the rear passenger window regulator fails.  I repair and replace it myself again.  AND THEN, the 3 month old alternator takes a crap went ahead and replaced it myself again..(Being somewhat mechanically knowledgeable, I figured i could save a lot of money on repairs a shop would charge) As of now, July2017, it is sitting at the mechanic.  It recently started misfiring and wouldn't run for more than a minute. I replaced a bad valve cover gasket, spark plugs.

 on 08/25/16 23:57 PM (PDT),Mo ,2001 BMW 3 Series Sedan 330xi AWD 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M),Looks great but is always trying to break.," I bought this car in 2014 on June and boy was i happy. Loved the looks and performance. IT was always polished and detailed once a month since the start of time. 2 months after buying this from BMW dealer from a one owner the belts and pulleys went bad. I Took it to the shop and had it replaced with the OEM parts. ""Note i only did OEM replacements for everything your about to read."" My shop during the repair found out the front axel had gone bad as well as the engine mounts and transmission mounts. Reminder to those reading my shop is a very reliable shop in the Bay Area with 100+ cars a day. So after finding out bought the new axel with the mounts right away. Drove the vehicle for a month and everything was ok. Winter night decided to go get a Starbucks coffee before i took off to go flying, ""reminder i am a pilot"". As i walk back i notice severe smoke coming from the hood. I popped the hood open the and expansion tank was cracked. I had the car towed to the shop and had that changed right away. As they where checking the saw the hose was bad as well as the water pump and the radiator looked as though it was ready to go. Ended up replacing all the parts right away thinking id keep the car still. A month goes by after all that and i get a check engine light after driving from Los Angelas. I diagnose the code since i use to work on cars at one point and it was the O2 Sensors. Jeez Lucky me it was the month i had to smog the car. Again back to the shop and had the O2 sensors replaced. Very expensive. After driving back from the shop i notice smoke again from the hood. Look under Valve cover gasket was bad. Turned around and left the car over night till they replaced that. I drive the car for two months and again smoke from the hood. I check and again valve cover leak. I take it to the shop and it was not the cover but the valve cover its self that went bad. $300 is the cost of that cover. I said screw it ill deal with it. YES the valve cover was torqued correctly when i had the gasket changed. Another month goes by and on the free way i get a check engine light and the car down shifted harshly to send gear from 4th. Found out the alternator went bad. Ridicoulas. I was about ready to destroy this car. Note i did change the differential fluid and the transmission fluid right away when i bought the car due to this generation having transmission problems on the automatic version. 3 months or so went by from all the BS and i decide to go to the snow with my new continental DWS tires. When i got on the freeway and got close to lake Tahoe and to the snow the steering wheel got very very heavy.... Power steering killed it self. Regardless since it was gone i was already in the snow. Drove it and ill say despite not having power steering this car handles amazing in the snow. So when i got back i poured a temporary power steering fluid fix. Aprox a week went by when i put the fluid and i was rear ended by a jeep in traffic and i hit the car in front. The impact was very hard. The winch on the jeep hit me and i damaged the impala in front. The front didn't have a scratch beside the license plate frame damaged on my car but the impala was damaged from behind. The back bumper had a hole but over all it was a hard hit and it coped well. Two months later sold the car with bad power steering and shocks. Never again buying a new BMW. Now driving a 2006 C55 AMG Mercedes. Ive always owned Mercedes and never again will i buy a bmw. My relative had a 1994 318i and that was bullet proof, close to 400,000, parts original.

Other relative had a 2004 530i and had problems with tranny and electronics. 2006 325i electrical problem. 2008 750li electrical and engine problems.

Read this one!," I wanted:  stick-shift, black n'black, all-wheel drive, sharp-looking car.  When you consider the options and the prices, the higher-mileage BMW was definitely the right combination of features for the right price...admittedly with quiet risks attached..?  I read reviews, watched youtube videos, and kept my ears alert for advice from people with first-hand experience.  I bought the car with about 95,000 miles from a rather 'out-of-the-way' (we'll call it) car lot.  The combination of transmission, color, AWD, and year was very difficult to find - I would come back from test drives and someone else would be waiting.  I ended up getting the car a state away (Ohio).  I *assumed* I'd have to deal with the previous owner(s) not doing routine maintenance - and I assumed correctly.  Before I get into what all happened and how I handled it, a short bit about me:  electrical engineer with a life (so far) fixing my own cars.  First issue was the radio.  Decided on its own when to turn on or off...at first I thought the car was telling it to turn on and off, but after a far-to-lengthy analysis, I just replaced the radio (eBay, $300)...it has been fine ever since.  A few months later, the car began one day to run as if the engine was missing a cylinder.  I changed the spark plugs and all was well.  Again a month or so later...changed all the coil packs.  All good ever since (year+) (routine maintenance! did it myself; parts were about $200).  Sometime between the plugs/coils and the next repair I'll talk about shortly was the passenger-side rear tail light - a row of LEDs went out.  This caused the car to limit energy to the entire tail light, which made it look dim.  $60 and two bolts and that was OK (apparently there may have been a recall; didn't bother). Also replaced the battery.  It simply wouldn't hold a charge; $180 (big battery, did that myself too, routine maintenance!). Up until this point, I had no issues.  The car is a joy to drive and those repairs weren't a huge deal to me, maybe because I am handy.  The two profoundly irritating repairs were the blower motor for the heat/AC and the coolant pump.  On one of the coldest days this winter (so far), I was out of town (Chicago) for a wedding.  On my way home to Pittsburgh, the blower decided that it just didn't feel like turning on.  It was something like 15-20*F.  Fortunately, turning the air control to 'outside air' allowed the highway driving to keep me warm.  When I got home, I pulled the blower motor out myself (a known issue, since then a recall has been issued), lubricated the motor shaft, and reinstalled it.  All good so far.  Once you get the hang of it, its not too bad of a job...maybe 1/2 hour if you have a new blower on-hand.  Finally - the big one...the (electric) coolant pump.  As an engineer, I understand the concept, but I think I would've kept a crucial engine component like this mechanical to prevent what happened...it died.  On my birthday (4th of July), it proceeded to overheat (on one of the hottest days last year).  This repair was something I was willing to do, however, the car was too low to the ground for me to efficiently do it (would've needed a lift). I broke down and spent the $1,000 and all was well...for a minute.  Every once in awhile, the car informs me of a low coolant level...I assume a small leak somewhere (these cars have crap coolant systems, known fact)...so I will look into it when it isn't winter anymore.  At the moment, it's fine.  So - would I buy another one? YES.  Shifts like a dream, rides like a dream, the AWD is fantastic in wet/snowy conditions.  Gas mileage is OK (around 20mpg mixed conditions; I drive more aggressively, probably due to the stick-shift).  For some reason, when pumping gas, the fuel pump clicks off before it's full.  After a half tank, it takes a little while giving it fuel between clicks of the pump.  Slightly annoying, but not the end of the world.   Seat heaters are awesome in the winter.  Engine is a fantastic mechanical masterpiece...so balanced it sounds like a sports bike revving-up.  The controls and gauges are the usual beautiful red - easy on the eyes at night, everything is in a logical place and generally intuitive.  The cup holders are irritating if your cup doesn't have a lid (and sometimes even if your drink is full and does have a lid), but whatever.  Overall, if you do what you should do to a car and you diagnose problems properly and fix the easy ones, it hasn't been a bad car at all.  It's a joy to drive, and I love that it's the one I walk up to in the parking lot...the thing is gorgeous...keep up the maintenance and have a little money aside when that coolant pump/blower motor goes bad.  All-and-all I gave it a 4/5 across the board...dings for the radio, coolant pump, and blower motor.

The engine oil and coolant fluid have to be topped off regularly.  Oh, and the hood release doesn't work, so the car has to be taken to a mechanic for those simple maintenance tasks.  The gas tank closure broke.  And don't even get started on the run-flat tires.  I order extras now because I know the winter pothole season will ruin one or two tires, and last year a rim, too.

Previously owned numerous motorcycles (including 6-cylinder KZ1300) and performance cars (including Porsche 914/6 - a near perfect car for its day).  Now older, expected to act more mature & ""within my current station in life"" (though I don't want to) as a stalwart, semi-conservative, church-going member of my community .  This car is a perfect fit for that scenario - looks appropriate for someone in a suit & tie, but can still tear it up when you want!POSITIVES:My car is an early production model for 2013, having been built in South African & bought by me in April.  It has the seven speed automatic transmission - not the manual.  I refer to my 335i as a ""stealth"" street racer (with a luxury interior).  With the lower curb weight and same turbo 3.0 liter six-cylinder (N55) engine, it out-performs the larger 535i and a few others of the 6- & 7- series cars.  Considering that 95% of my driving is done with myself, or self & wife (5'4"", 105 lbs), the car is plenty roomy.  I've even had four full-sized adults in it for a 200 mile (3 hour) trip and no one made comments about lack of space.  Actually gets better mileage when on the Interstate running at about 80 MPH (West Texas & Utah), than down in the lower speed limits (65-70 MPH).  Goes where you point it & stays there!  The three different driving modes (Sport/Comfort/Economy) are great.  Most driving in Comfort range, but when I want some fun I put it in Sport mode - where it can be a terror (but fun to drive)!  CAUTION: Do not ""stomp"" on the accelerator (in either Comfort or Sport) unless you have both hands on the steering, wheel!  It will literally throw you back into your seat when you do (first time I did it I wasn't paying attention, had only one had on the wheel & was entering a transition curve from one freeway to another - I almost lost it).  It really is ""The Ultimate Driving"" machine in that I've taken it round trip from San Diego to the East Coast three times (average of 6000 miles in three weeks, or less) in the almost three years I've had it.  That doesn't even begin to count the number of times I've taken it from San Diego up to San Francisco (550 miles one-way) & back on weekends.  In each case I was able to make the drive with very little fatigue at the end of each day's driving.  The most distance I've covered in a single day in the 335i has been 1100 miles (one day of driving on one of the previously mentioned coast-to-coast trips).NEGATIVES: It took my dealership multiple tries to get my alignment correct in that I was always wearing the front tires on the outside edges (Yes, I keep all tire pressures per manufacturer's specs) and on the inside edge of the rear tires.  I had to work to get 40K miles on a set of tires (not cheap at about $1200 every time a new set goes on - for the least expensive brand/model tire recommended for the 335i).  I finally made adjustments to my tire pressures (increased the front & reduced the rear) resulting in the tires wearing (slightly) longer & much more evenly - with no apparent degradation of handling/performance!  My headlights always look like their aimed too low, unless on high beam, but I've been told (numerous times) they're set correctly.  I'm still not excited about the automatic shift lever where you have to pull it back toward you when you want to go ""forward"" (out of park/neutral) and push it forward when you want to go into ""reverse,"" but am now used to that (in fact I know that is the historical European throttle setup in aircraft, so guess it makes sense to the Germans).  Other than tires, I've only had to replace a faulty brake sensor switch (after over 2 years & about 75,000 miles).  Still pads left on all brakes at over 125K miles (maybe I'm easy on brakes).  Right rear tail light lens had to be adjusted within about 18 months (kept coming loose), but easy fix on that (covered by warranty).OVERALL:Car has been rock solid and one heck of a bunch of fun to drive!  Get one if you get the chance (a bunch should be coming up for sale after finishing their 3-year lease with original drivers).  When I purchased my 335i my expectation is that it would last for at least 8 years and go for 250,000 miles and it looks like it will easily make that (I also have a 2003 Ford F-150 that is now 15 years old & has over 435,000 miles on it), since we're now at 5 years and I have over 125K on it.  My wife is using it for her daily driver in a major Calif metro area and loves it for that.

The car was delivered factory perfect and has only had one recall and one software upgrade.  It delivers the same range as when it was new.What the car is: An incredibly fun, nimble, exhilarating, holy cow, I can't believe a car can be this fun to drive, I feel like I am 16, where can I go next car.  The drive train and ride are un-naturally smooth and quiet.  It's remarkable.  It's fun in a vintage English sports car way complete with very predicable 4 wheel drifts, blazing acceleration, wicked torque and grand prix ""one pedal"" driving.  The car effortlessly dives into turns with the regen breaking acting like a hand break to unlock the back wheels, only to instantly re-engage as you hit the accelerator (yes, that is what it is) to power out of the turns.  Anyone that drives this car as a hyper miler is missing one the best driving experiences imaginable.  The fun comes from a combination of super-car ratio of torque-to-weight and grossly inadequate tires.  The latter is so poor that you can have all this fun below 40mph instead of 80 in an M5 or Vette.  That's not a bad thing.What it is not - a highway car.  At speeds above 80 this car is a white knuckle death ride and will take every bit of your driving skills to keep control.  It's top speed is governed at 98 but it has a practical limit of about 75.  If you are a pre-dawn commuter accustomed to hitting triple digits with your fellow commuters, step away and find another car.  As example of how slow you need to drive this car, I historically have an avg driving speed of 44mph while in this car it's 33!.  I guess it could use some air dams to keep the air from floating the car  - maybe they could also help keep the car from getting airborne on mountain roads too.  Living electric - you have to want to.  This is an 90% car meaning it fills 90% of your car needs and am able to use it with some planning for almost everything except weekend trips with the family.   I use a level 1, 110v charger at home and it comfortably charges the car overnight (10K is about 25mile/day) on most days.  I only need to use public charges 2-3 times/month for the longer trips.  Using some ""extreme couponing"" type planning, I can string together 150 mile jaunts and have done 400miles in a weekend using only 1qt of gas.  It's possible because the range extending engine does its job to allow you to use the full batter capacity (I get about 80mile range in the summer and 60 mile in winter).  The REX however is in sharp contrast to the ultra refined electric drive in that it's  roughness, loudness and vibration is on par with your father's vintage tractor.  It works fine in city/suburban driving but the algorithms that control the battery reserves are not set for highway driving especially in the mountains.  A short hill quickly depletes the battery's reserve and you will find yourself seeking refuge from speeding cars behind a tandem trailer as you slow to 50mph to prevent an emergency shut-down.   Living with the car - The phone interface is incredibly disappointing and archaic.  The car rarely recognizes the phone when plugged in but still locks out most phone features (for obvious safety reasons) so you either have to do without or reinitiate the apps.   BMW's newest addition to the iDrive system is ""graffiti"" style input circa 1992 Palm Pilot.  The voice recognition is very poor and frustrating.  It could be due to a poor microphone or its placement.  There are however two redeeming features - you can bypass the car's labyrinth of commands and access Siri via a button on the steering wheel or use one of 8 programable buttons on the dash to get instant access to any car/phone function.  The sound system is a disappointment and certainly not on level with the car's price tag (I have the standard system).  Fortunately you don't spend a lot of time in this car but if you rely on your phone for music, navigation and calls, you will be disappointed.  I use it as an excuse to unplug connect to the kids and enjoy the drive.The car's navigation system is equally poor.  I used it only 3-4 times and stopped after it directed me the wrong way on a 1-way street.  On a separate occasion it dropped us in the middle of a cemetary instead of a soccer field.

Unbelievable a 50K car that is broke, takes this long to repair and requires the help of Germany to repair.Update since first post:Car has been in repair now 3 times, the latest as on June 2016, the check engine light is ON, Dealer says BMW Engineers are trying to find out why. The car is always broken. Funny thing, when I went to drop off my i3 for repairs, there were 2 i3's in front of me, one so bad they had to put it on a dolly to move it.Let me also point out a few of the down sides of owing this car:1. The rear doors opening in the suicide fashion are also not a very good design, especially in parking lots with other vehicles parked close by. For example, say you have a child, you need to open both the front door, then the rear. You are now trapped between two doors, you have to fight with one of the doors to keep closing then opening to get to the stroller to get your child. Also if you are shopping and need to put things in the rear seat, same thing. A REAL PAIN... Don't believe me, give it a try with cars parked on each side that hug the white stripe. Then you will wish you din't have this car.Next the rear storage is small at best, you can't fit a full size stroller in the rear. If you do have a stroller, then you have no place for groceries.Now on to the body of the car, it is really a collection of plastic parts snapped together, most are very flimsy at best, and if you really stand back and look at the car, there are at least 4 different colors on the car. Looks like an erector set gone bad. The fit is also not very good. The front gas cover is really a terrible design with the locking as the pin is at the bottom and can be easily opened. Just a waste on the lock. So many curves and design elements. A real pain to clean the outside with so many panels and shapes.Next, did I say the rear windows do not roll down. They don't and another let down.  The tires are very different and skinny, makes the car very un stable feeling when you hit a smooth bump in the road such as a railroad track crossing, you can feel the car slide. Also if it's wet outside, even worst! Please don't speed around any corners with these skinny tires. Overall, the car has many short comings and things you never think about until you have it. It was neat looking in the showroom. In the real world, this is one of the worst cars I have ever owned/leased.
