Handles like it's velcroed to the road, especially in the rain.  Firmly pegged on the ""Sport"" end of the SUV spectrum, these unique finds benefit significantly from a more involved driver's hand.  While clearly geared toward fuel economy--I've observed a surprising 19.5 MPG over three months'-worth of mixed driving, the seven-speed's ""Drive Sport"" mode is a must-engage when turning onto the twisties.

And despite a somewhat CX-yawn exterior, the 2014's enlarged grill (masking dual engine air intakes), 21"" custom Enkei rims, and 5.0 side badges subtly communicate that this beast shares 370Z & GT-R DNA and would best be left to prowl far afield from the minivan-ified crossover herd.",5.0,"Fastest naturally aspirated SUV (still!) 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.  *This* is the first stat potential FX50 or V8 QX70 owners should consider.

I was less fortunate than RohanB I ended up hitting the guard rail and spinning around luckily did not hit any other vehicle.  Just like his review going down highway it was raining.  If I recall right I was just easily sliding into middle lane and then it went hard right and felt like hydroplaning.  I have been driving for almost 30 years. I am not a speeder no speeding ticket since my teenage years.  Thank God the other safety features was awesome in the car.  We both got out okay...my son had a few bruises...but we are alive and well.  I do have the headache of dealing with an out of state wreck but will take that vs other options!  There is your PSA from me stay away from adaptive steering technology.  Perhaps 99% ok but it's the 1% that matters when it's life or death.  I had no idea I was renting a car with that technology.

Drove about 1,000 miles over Wyoming and Utah, exposed to city and country driving. Interior: Very comfortable but the quality and fit/finish doesn't match up to the Germans. It actually doesn't match up to the quality of fit and finish of my 2012 VW GTI. Exterior: FREAKING BEAUTIFUL. This has to be most beautiful and attention grabbing design within the 50-60K price bracket (save for a Mustang). Everyone takes double looks and it definitely appears like a 100K car. Performance: Straight line performance is amazing, could have a nicer exhaust, but there are several aftermarket solutions without making it sound ricer. Now for the part why I would NOT recommend this car - Steering and Safety: The steering has a mind of it's own - I was constantly making minor corrections on a straight piece of highway doing the speed limit (70 MPH).  It seems like the adaptive steering tries to second guess the driver, but as the driver, you don't expect the car to make that correction by itself so you either end up overcorrecting or jerking/lurching the car. Lane changes on the highway became difficult. THE WORST PART - When doing 70MPH in moderate rain, this car almost wiped out. This was again, on a straight piece of road, the steering system twitched and sent the car into a near wipeout, as I almost lost the rear end of this AWD car. I ended up bringing it back in control, but never felt comfortable driving it again, especially since I had my wife in the car and wiping out at 70MPH would have definitely injured (or worse) us both. Absolutely do not recommend this car - I have driven econoboxes that would do better in the rain at these speeds (including my elantra, civic) as well as my amazing (now even more so) VW GTI",3.0,"Glad I rented it before buying it - Beware I rented a pretty sweet Infiniti Q60 with the 6-cylinder/300HP engine over the long weekend.

Unless you have a stage coach, having a feel for every pebble on the road  an be cumbersome, on long trips. The Q60 is a Grand Touring style coupe.  It gives comfort and performance in one package.

The collision avoidance works very well, and the pro pilot assist greatly reduces fatigue on long road trips. Whenever I drive a car without the electronic steering it feel very tedious to drive.

 on 11/30/17 10:28 AM (PST),In-fan-iti ,2017 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),More SSUH Than SUV," I consider this a good point as it gives me lots of flexibility, and i don't need a large vehicle with massive cargo. It is still an unusual vehicle, and knowing the gas consumption, you are silly to buy it if that is a primary concern. I know in the past I have gotten better than rated mileage on this particular engine/setup (3.7L, 7 speed auto) as it has been very responsive with a feather touch on the gas, and I have a lead foot. I call it more a Sport Sedan Utility Hatchback, than a full fledged SUV. Remember hatchbacks? They had a higher cargo area you could expand if you needed to haul things around that were odd sizes, like a bicycle. the cargo area is a really good size by my standards, but smaller than some I have seen, but you could still carry quite a bit. As far as the packages, which were mentioned in the Edmunds review, they come pretty well loaded for a $35,000 SUV (the base, RWD model). I added the premium and premium plus packages for the upgraded radio, navigation, and several other features. The premium Pkg is $500, the Premium Plus is $1,000, but requires the Premium Package. I also got, just because it was closest to what I wanted, the 19"" wheel package for $800. Pretty cheap as far as packages go. The babysitting tools and other things I had no interest in are in the Technology Package, which has an awful lot of stuff in it for $2,000, including all the babysitting tools. That covers ALL the packages offered. The only other things are little accessories (most you won't need), and of course I wanted AWD. As far as the engine, I would gladly take the V-6 over many of the turbocharged competitors, and it happens to be a very reliable V-6 at that. I will be extremely sad to see it go from most infiniti vehicles in place of turbocharging, and the totally new engine for 2019 for this car. I sat in the back seat to try it out, and pushed the front seat farther back than I usually use it (I am 5'9"") and found the rear seat not a bad place to be for two adults (I would not ever put an adult in the middle because of the hump in the floor for the drivetrain), but the back seat has it own heat vents (under the seat) and a/c vents that can be turned off and adjusted (back of the center console). I actually found the navigation really easy to use and input addresses, as well as to control other settings for the car. And I LOVE that the Radio and climate controls are separate (though you can also use the unit for the radio or the steering wheel.  As far as bluetooth, yes, it does work for voice and for audio media, you just need to make sure it is set for both, otherwise it will only search for voice bluetooth systems. As far as driving, as I said before, there is tons of power, a sport driving mode, and manual shift on the stick, not on the wheel. Personally, considering how little I shift an automatic manually, they are more a hindrance than help on the wheel. I don't think it matters for everyday driving, but I have AWD. I have taken corners faster than I probably should have given it is a slightly higher center of gravity, and it drives very well on curvy roads as well as the highway. Since it is not the fastest selling of Infiniti's vehicles, you can often get a great deal on them, and unless you need more room than a compact vehicle will provide (again, remember it is compact) will provide or fuel economy is a huge priority for you, I say definitely test it and buy it if it suits your needs. Infiniti dealers are giving darned good discounts. I would say, depending on level of equipment (they max out around $45,000 MSRP), you can save $5,000 to $8,000 off sticker without much haggling. I saved $7,000, plus got an infiniti Loyalty Rebate good for another (I think) $1,000, and i really did not haggle.... I picked a car, and the saleswoman went and came back with the best price, then added the rebate, and I said great.

 on 05/10/16 12:09 PM (PDT),Honey Badger ,2016 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Great sporty crossover," I was looking for something very specific: the utility of a crossover (not necessarily luxury) while maintaining the sporty quality that makes me happy in daily driving. To get sportier in this segment, you would have to move to the Porsche Macan or the Mercedes GLA 450 AMG, neither anywhere near my budget. For the money, this is the best deal out there, given the specifics I was looking for. Some specific details below.- The expected good: Powerful engine, faster linear acceleration than my previous GTI. I pull out of traffic stops faster than most cars, without really trying; Nice interior feel, comfortable and understated luxury; the AWD is fantastic, the rear wheel traction makes for great handling on dry road, and in rain or snow it makes it easy to drive with minimal adaptation. It feels like you can throw anything at it, and you can take the car anywhere. - The better than expected good: the 360 view camera and the navigation were pleasant surprises, after review complaints about the design being outdated; A ton of room in the rear seats, makes for nice comments from any passengers you take along; Infiniti customer service is so far superb! The dealer over-inflated the tires (actually forgot to lower the pressure after delivery), which, combined with new owner paranoia, made me worried about long term effect on suspensions after driving on it. After just one email, Infiniti promptly extended the suspension, direction and breaks warranty, no questions asked, and followed up to make sure I was happy. Nice change from the VW customer serviceâ¦- The expected bad: fuel economy is poor, if you drive it in a sporty manner. The V6 begs you to do just that, and expresses its satisfaction nicely with a lively low grunt. I expected this, and can live with it; the Bose sound system: the greatest scam in consumer electronics. I know a lot of people will disagree, because TV said Bose is good, and most people cannot tell the difference between good audio and bloated midrange that distorts well-recorded music and dupes 95% of the population into thinking ""it sounds good"".- The unexpected bad: less storage space and room around the driver than my much smaller GTI! I adapted to it though; The thing with the overinflated tires on delivery (see above) took some of the new car elation away, but both Infiniti and the dealership have been very prompt to address it. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I miss some of the fast turning of a sports hatchback, but the peace of mind driving in any condition, the comfort, satisfying acceleration and smooth highway performance make me forget I'm in an SUV instead of a sporty car. The price makes this car an excellent deal, as all the competitors in this ""luxury"" small SUV/crossover segment are all both pricier and less athletic!

Looked and drove MANY crossovers. In the end, we really liked the known reliability and power of the VQ engine. The crossover drives like a fast car, I have no problem passing cars at high speeds and it gets up to speed effortless when entering the freeway. The seats are very comfortable and the interior has more of a ""classic"" feel to it. Electronics are average, nothing out of the ordinary. Technology is great, parking with the 360 cameras makes the job much easier while having the front sensing brakes gives you peace of mind. At around 10mph, we had a child jump in front of the car unexpectedly and the vehicle stopped automatically. Can not speak of reliability yet but required maintenance mainly includes basic oil changes every 6months and brake flush every 2 years. There are many different options out there but we chose this crossover because of the sporty way it drives, the known VQ engine, and the options it has for the price. We are very happy and will considered buying an Infiniti again in the future. 3.24.17 Update: The only downfall is that the AC developed a wet dirty rag smell like mold. I took it in and they told me there was nothing wrong but they had cleaned it and put some smelly thing on it. It only masked the musty smell but did not fix it. They suggested I turn off the a/c and let the vent blow just air to dry the vents as this sometimes happens. We did research and apparently other people were having the same problem. I don't think it's reasonable to ask me to do something special with the A/C for it to work appropriately especially on very hot days when I really need the A/c to work properly.

WTF - ~15% difference?!  most of my driving REQUIRES air conditioner due to weather so this is a big issue.automated highway driving - if there is a large obstruction in middle of highway, the car not sense it and plow right into it.  its only when there is a moving object (vehicle) in front, when the car senses the manages acceleration/brakes.  if this is important to you, look into new models or other vehicles.~Jan-2014:I've had the qx60 hybrid and for about 3 mo now, 2300 miles.If I knew how poorly hybrid performs in the city (supposed to be hybrid vehicle strength) I would not have gone for hybrid.Let me repeat this, the car is great! Lots of room, great safety features, but I want my money back for ""hybrid"" part. City mpg of 25 is nowhere to be found, no matter how slow or fast acceleration, ease of breaking, Ac/no ac, no matter what I tried.I max out around 15mpg on a good day around city and hit as low as 9mpg occasionally without trying.Infiniti, I hope you are listening and are not going to drop your customers now that we have given you the money.","[('City mpg', 'mpg')]","['more findings', 'slow acceleration']","[['car', 'love'], ['vehicle', 'year'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['like', 'year', 'car', 'new'], ['vehicle', 'car', 'love'], ['year'], ['nt', 'car'], ['year'], ['drive'], ['one'], ['one'], ['one'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt', 'vehicle', 'car'], ['nt', 'vehicle', 'new'], ['miles', 'now'], ['vehicle', 'one', 'new'], ['nt', 'car', 'one', 'great'], ['good'], ['one', 'give']]","[('city rating', 'rating'), ('mpg rating', 'rating'), ('utility vehicle', 'vehicle'), ('body shop', 'shop'), ('dealer fee', 'fee'), ('door dings', 'dings'), ('highway driving', 'driving'), ('chip car', 'car'), ('% highway', 'highway'), ('% city', 'city'), ('air conditioner', 'conditioner'), ('air conditioner', 'conditioner'), ('% difference', 'difference'), ('REQUIRES air', 'air'), ('air conditioner', 'conditioner'), ('manages acceleration', 'acceleration'), ('vehicle strength', 'strength'), ('safety features', 'features')]","['light scratch', 'new models', 'bad door dings', 'single scratch', '~15 % difference', 'hybrid performs', 'reliable utility vehicle', 'completely repaint', 'want back', 'large obstruction', 'hybrid part', 'other utility vehicles', 'hybrid vehicle strength', 'amazing paint', 'big issue', 'love well', 'great safety features', 'good day', 'poorly hybrid performs', 'far holding', 'only t', 'inside door', 'minimal door', 'single chip car', 'far spent', 'hit occasionally', 'had now', 'holding well']",pos

I was looking for something that was comfortable for the driver, since my feet have issues in alot of cars with not enough legroom and awkward resting spots for my non-driving foot.  The interior was sharp, albeit missing basics for an expensive ""luxury"" car, like blind spot mirrors if not a blind spot warning system.

 on 06/10/16 14:32 PM (PDT),Happy Buyer ,2016 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Absolutely in Love with my New QX60," I test drove probably every three row SUV on the market before deciding on the QX60.  I had been driving a 2011 Toyota Sienna that had over 140,000 miles on it and felt it was time to start looking for a new car.  Prior to that car I leased three other minivans...two Honda and another Sienna.  It was time to move on from the minivan, however I still needed a true third row to have teenage kids sit in from time to time as well as ample cargo space.  Most of the other three row SUV's have a joke of a third row that is only meant for someone under ten years old.  I test drove the AUDI Q7 and although it's a beautiful car, the third row wasn't nearly as accessible or large as this one and to get all of the equipment I got in the QX60 it would have cost more than $15,000 more.  The same story for the Mercedes and the BMW with the BMW having the smallest third row.  I considered the Toyota Highlander, and although that is a very nice car with ample room, it's just not nearly as luxurious as the Infiniti QX60, and is quite sparce with the interior details.  I even considered the new Honda Pilot fully loaded, until I read all of the Edmunds reviews, and that car for now is a load of trouble.  Plus again, it just wasn't as luxurious as this car.  The styling of the QX60 is beautiful.  The 2016 interior has been tweaked and is now really beautiful.  I had looked at the 2015 a few months earlier and didn't love the interior which was why it initially fell off of my short list.  When the 2016 came out I revisited the car, and the decision became clear. Technology - the technology is extremely user friendly.  Everything is intuitive and so easy to learn.  The voice command system actually works and understands what you are saying.  So many of the other cars I test drove did not.  The navigation is equally easy to use and prompts you early enough to make the system easy to follow.  The sound system is outstanding.  I think they told me it's a 13 speaker BOSE system.  It fills the car beautifully with music.  I did get the top of the line model with every bell and whistle available.  The new safety features this car has are awesome as well.  I love the road departure feature and the cross traffic alert.  The car comes with a ton of outside cameras which is super useful as well when parking.  I can actually look at the side camera view with the touch of one button and see if my car is too close or far from the curb if I am parallel parking or even parking in a regular space.  I love that the car came equipped with heated seats (front and rear) and A/C seats in the front.  The A/C seats really works quickly and makes it so comfortable to drive when you get into a hot car.  Interior - Plenty of storage space.  I wanted a large center console and this one has a two level console which houses everything but in an organized manner.  The glove compartment is equally huge.   The second row is adjustable front and back and the seats recline as well.  The third row seats recline as well which makes you feel like there is more room if you are sitting in third row.  If you are a tall adult you probably wouldn't want to go on a really long trip, but an hour or so would be no big deal to sit back there.  Behind the third row there is a hidden compartment underneath to store a few things as well.  Overall this car is the perfect fit for me.  It gives me everything I was looking for...a luxurious vehicle that I can really enjoy whether driving alone or toting the kids all over in.",5.0,"Absolutely in Love with my New QX60 I test drove probably every three row SUV on the market before deciding on the QX60.

Prior to that car I leased three other minivans...two Honda and another Sienna.  It was time to move on from the minivan, however I still needed a true third row to have teenage kids sit in from time to time as well as ample cargo space.  Most of the other three row SUV's have a joke of a third row that is only meant for someone under ten years old.  I test drove the AUDI Q7 and although it's a beautiful car, the third row wasn't nearly as accessible or large as this one and to get all of the equipment I got in the QX60 it would have cost more than $15,000 more.  The same story for the Mercedes and the BMW with the BMW having the smallest third row.  I considered the Toyota Highlander, and although that is a very nice car with ample room, it's just not nearly as luxurious as the Infiniti QX60, and is quite sparce with the interior details.  I even considered the new Honda Pilot fully loaded, until I read all of the Edmunds reviews, and that car for now is a load of trouble.  Plus again, it just wasn't as luxurious as this car.  The styling of the QX60 is beautiful.  The 2016 interior has been tweaked and is now really beautiful.  I had looked at the 2015 a few months earlier and didn't love the interior which was why it initially fell off of my short list.  When the 2016 came out I revisited the car, and the decision became clear. Technology - the technology is extremely user friendly.  Everything is intuitive and so easy to learn.  The voice command system actually works and understands what you are saying.  So many of the other cars I test drove did not.  The navigation is equally easy to use and prompts you early enough to make the system easy to follow.  The sound system is outstanding.  I think they told me it's a 13 speaker BOSE system.  It fills the car beautifully with music.  I did get the top of the line model with every bell and whistle available.  The new safety features this car has are awesome as well.  I love the road departure feature and the cross traffic alert.  The car comes with a ton of outside cameras which is super useful as well when parking.  I can actually look at the side camera view with the touch of one button and see if my car is too close or far from the curb if I am parallel parking or even parking in a regular space.  I love that the car came equipped with heated seats (front and rear) and A/C seats in the front.  The A/C seats really works quickly and makes it so comfortable to drive when you get into a hot car.  Interior - Plenty of storage space.  I wanted a large center console and this one has a two level console which houses everything but in an organized manner.  The glove compartment is equally huge.   The second row is adjustable front and back and the seats recline as well.  The third row seats recline as well which makes you feel like there is more room if you are sitting in third row.  If you are a tall adult you probably wouldn't want to go on a really long trip, but an hour or so would be no big deal to sit back there.  Behind the third row there is a hidden compartment underneath to store a few things as well.  Overall this car is the perfect fit for me.  It gives me everything I was looking for...a luxurious vehicle that I can really enjoy whether driving alone or toting the kids all over in.","[('line model', 'model')]","['same story', 'third row', 'sound system', 'easy to follow', 'prompts enough', 'smallest row', 'easy to use']","[['test'], ['miles', 'car', 'new'], ['car'], ['car'], ['nt', 'year', 'one'], ['nt', 'car', 'one', 'test'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt', 'car', 'new'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'love'], ['car'], ['nt'], ['work'], ['car', 'test'], ['think'], ['car'], ['car', 'new'], ['road', 'love'], ['come', 'car'], ['car', 'one'], ['nt', 'car', 'love'], ['drive', 'nt', 'car', 'work'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'one'], ['nt', 'love'], ['nt', 'second'], ['like'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['car'], ['give'], ['vehicle', 'one']]","[('row SUV', 'SUV'), ('cargo space', 'space'), ('Edmunds reviews', 'reviews'), ('voice command', 'command'), ('command system', 'system'), ('speaker system', 'system'), ('BOSE system', 'system'), ('road departure', 'departure'), ('departure feature', 'feature'), ('cross alert', 'alert'), ('traffic alert', 'alert'), ('camera view', 'view'), ('C seats', 'seats'), ('C seats', 'seats'), ('storage space', 'space'), ('center console', 'console'), ('level console', 'console'), ('glove compartment', 'compartment'), ('row seats', 'seats')]","['other minivans', 'toting over', 'perfect fit', 'comfortable to drive', 'new car', 'driving alone', 'true row', 'adjustable front', 'more room', 'still needed', 'big deal', 'departure features well', 'even considered', 'actually look', 'even parking', 'initially fell', 'long trip', 'store well', 'sit there', 'hidden glove compartment', 'parallel parking', 'third row', 'looked earlier', 'easy to learn', 'outside cameras', 'actually works', 'fully loaded', 'tall adult', 'Prior leased', 'luxurious vehicle', 'heated C C row seats', 'nice car', 'probably want', 'drove probably', 'regular cargo storage space', 'ample cargo storage space', 'second row', 'interior details', 'ample room', 'however needed', 'really enjoy', 'recline well', 'hot car', 'short list', 'other cars', 'beautiful car', 'only meant', 'really long trip', 'works quickly', 'very nice car', 'fills beautifully', 'organized manner', 'teenage kids', 'new safety', 'few months', 'large center level console', 'really works']",pos

We cross-shopped the QX60 and the Acura MDX heavily, but in the end, the Infiniti was more family-friendly, felt more upscale for the price, and had a far better dealer experience. As we approach the end of our lease, our opinion hasn't changed much. The QX60 is still a nice, upscale, family-friendly vehicle, and a great value when you consider real-world selling prices. Being able to tilt the second row with a car seat attached to get to the third row is invaluable for anyone with three children in car seats - I'm shocked that it's still the only luxury crossover on the market with this feature. That said, the infotainment and overall interior are definitely looking dated - Infiniti made some updates to both in 2017, but nothing has changed significantly. We still mostly have the M interior from a decade ago. We still have ugly, yellow, halogen interior lighting on a $50,000 luxury vehicle. We still have Nissan buttons everywhere. For those cross-shopping something like the XC90 or even the CX-9, the interior may come off as a bit of a hard sell during a test drive.It's only when you take the QX60 on a long drive with multiple kids in the car that you can appreciate how quiet and comfortable the interior is, especially on the highway. It's why we still have the QX60 our our short list for our next crossover - and that really says it all.Pros:- Extremely quiet and smooth, particularly on highways- Leases much better than its MSRP suggests- Second row can move for third row access even with a child seat installed- Excellent third row that is usable by adults (at least for short trips)- Cost to own/lease should be low - you can use Nissan dealers for scheduled maintenance at a lower priceCons:- Dated interior design and infotainment system- City/mixed gas mileage isn't great - we never got close to the EPA average (this has been improved in the 2017 refresh)- Headlights are weak (this has not changed in the refreshes, even though they look better)- Slightly more jarring than expected on potholes given the class of vehicle- Nissan-esque packaging of options (a hands-free liftgate requires a $7,500 package?

The exterior styling is what sold the QX60 to my wife even through the Atlas has a nice panoramic sunroof similar to Audi's (QX60's is lacking...not as grand/nice).

 on 04/04/18 20:45 PM (PDT),Lori D. Moore ,2003 INFINITI M45 Sedan 4dr Sedan (4.5L 8cyl 5A),It's Like driving a Race Horse," If you want to take long cross country trips and are my age (63) then take breaks so you don't get sore.  The seats are sports car seats, not plushy cushy seats.  The suspension isn't soft or cushy either but let me tell you, hang onto your hat when you give it the gas!!  You don't really need to slow down much to take a corner.  There just isn't any body roll and this car can deliver.  I grew up with the 1960's muscle cars and everything that went with it.  I am female and a great grandmother, but I do enjoy driving in a sporty manner.  Since I live in So Cal, I can drive the freeways with ""authority"".   My M45 is 15 years old now and has 137K miles on it.  Have NEVER had a repair on this car.  Just the normal maintenance stuff.  Now that it is older, there are more road noises that I hear and my CD player quit working but what would one expect at this age?   The M45 doesn't like our dirt roads much and it doesn't absorb the stutter bumps very well but it does love a mountain road and a remote road where you can loosen up the reins and let her run.  When you have it in the manual mode, it seems to lunge forward and you need to be prepared for that at a stop sign.  Alot of people think the manual mode is worthless, but they don't let it wind out enough.  Honestly, you need to have this car for a while  and really learn how to drive it.   In the years that I have had the M45, I have seen only 2 others like it.  When I have taken to get tires or an oil change, the comments you hear are ""This sure is a nice car and you don't see M's on the road""  It is a very capable car especially for its weight but that is something I like because you feel like the car is solid and ""on the road"" not ""floating above it"".    If you are looking for a strictly luxury car, then you probably won't think it's all that but if you want a combination of luxury and high performance, this is the one for you.  The instrument panel some people find confusing but all you need to do is read your owners manual and you will see how easy it really is.  There are multi-function controls so you need just to touch the component you wish to control and then look at the buttons numbered 1-6 and push the one that is appropriate.  Easy peasy lemon squeezy!!  THIS CAR IS SO MUCH FUN TO DRIVE!",5.0,"It's Like driving a Race Horse If you want to take long cross country trips and are my age (63) then take breaks so you don't get sore.  The seats are sports car seats, not plushy cushy seats.  The suspension isn't soft or cushy either but let me tell you, hang onto your hat when you give it the gas!!  You don't really need to slow down much to take a corner.  There just isn't any body roll and this car can deliver.  I grew up with the 1960's muscle cars and everything that went with it.  I am female and a great grandmother, but I do enjoy driving in a sporty manner.  Since I live in So Cal, I can drive the freeways with ""authority"".   My M45 is 15 years old now and has 137K miles on it.  Have NEVER had a repair on this car.  Just the normal maintenance stuff.  Now that it is older, there are more road noises that I hear and my CD player quit working but what would one expect at this age?   The M45 doesn't like our dirt roads much and it doesn't absorb the stutter bumps very well but it does love a mountain road and a remote road where you can loosen up the reins and let her run.  When you have it in the manual mode, it seems to lunge forward and you need to be prepared for that at a stop sign.  Alot of people think the manual mode is worthless, but they don't let it wind out enough.  Honestly, you need to have this car for a while  and really learn how to drive it.   In the years that I have had the M45, I have seen only 2 others like it.  When I have taken to get tires or an oil change, the comments you hear are ""This sure is a nice car and you don't see M's on the road""  It is a very capable car especially for its weight but that is something I like because you feel like the car is solid and ""on the road"" not ""floating above it"".    If you are looking for a strictly luxury car, then you probably won't think it's all that but if you want a combination of luxury and high performance, this is the one for you.  The instrument panel some people find confusing but all you need to do is read your owners manual and you will see how easy it really is.  There are multi-function controls so you need just to touch the component you wish to control and then look at the buttons numbered 1-6 and push the one that is appropriate.

 on 07/29/16 22:51 PM (PDT),Driving Enthusiast ,2010 INFINITI FX35 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 7A),Impressive All Season Sportscar," I would call the FX35 an All Season Sportscar (I wonder why Infiniti didn't call it that...). You don't buy this car because you need room or utility. You buy this because you want a sports car that can be driven year round and in adverse conditions.First of all, the styling. While it might not be for everyone, I don't think anyone can argue it's bland. It is a striking design, and it is rare enough on the road that they really stand out. Kudos to Infiniti for rolling out a production car that actually looks like its concept sibling.Now onto performance, what this All Season Sportscar really excel at. I've had the pleasure of taking a high performance driving course with this car, and the theme of the day was ""Underestimated"". The brakes may look small next to the 20"" wheels, but they are surprisingly powerful and resilient. After a day at the track, the factory brakes were still going strong. And did I mention how strongly the car pulls and how good it sounds doing it? It's almost as if it's bending the laws of physics to do it. Handling is superb as well - it never once felt like I was driving tall heavy SUV through the slaloms and the avoidance maneuvers. The only thing that gave it away was the ride height - you won't be fooled into thinking you are in a Miata. The suspension is stiff enough through corners that the vehicle never feels ""soft"", yet for everyday commute it absorbs imperfections nicely. The car is much more capable within its performance envelope than any of us that day gave it credit for. However that doesn't mean you should get reckless behind it though - once you kick past the envelope and the laws of physics kick in, you're in the next zip code over before the 4200lb+ All Season Sportscar comes to a complete stop. Utility, storage volume in particular, is probably the Achilles' heel of the FX35. The spare tire under the rear cargo area bumps up the floor considerably. Couple that with the rakish coupe roofline, you have a low and wide opening that makes it next to impossible to load crates. The rear seats do fold down nicely, and the roof is considerably higher above the rear seats if you want to play some back seat tetris with your cargo. On a plus side though, because the roof is rakish and the hinge of the rear hatch is located so far forward, you can back the vehicle into a garage, and the hatch can still open even with only about a foot of space to the wall. Try doing that with other SUVs.In terms of utility off road, it does quite well light offroading, such as snow, mud, gravel or inclement weather conditions. With a good set of winter tires, the vehicle can handle snow covered mountain forest service roads without any drama (I have AWD). The interior is also a very welcoming and cozy space. The ambient lighting in the door handles is a very elegant touch, particularly if you have the maple accents. There are actually footwell accent lights too, but they are so dim (unless you swap them to LEDs) that they are not visible other than in the darkest of nights. The seats are very comfortable and well supported - no fatigue or butt cramps after long drives what-so-ever. Surfaces you are often in contact with are covered with soft leather material that just makes the whole cabin very luxurious-feeling. The backseat can recline to a very comfortable angle.The technology in the vehicle also leaves very little to be desired. I do not have the adaptive cruise control or lane departure warning systems, so I can't speak to those. The surround view camera though is absolutely brilliant. I call it ""cheat mode"", because it allows you to park the car in tight spaces with such confidence and ease that you'll passengers will be screaming ""Aww that's not fair!"". The Bose audio system is crisp, and if you're an avid CD listener you'll be happy to know the car will happily gobble up all the tracks on your CD and store them on its harddrive, so you never have to carry a stack of CDs with you. The navigation is also well voiced. Voice recognition is fast, although it can't take in a whole chunk of address at a time (i.e. you got to say the house number, wait, street address, wait, city, wait, etc). Unlike those OCD German car designs, the screen is a touchscreen, and the recessed setup makes it easily legible even in bright conditions. Another interior feature (somewhat useless) I really like is when you first get behind the wheels and turn the vehicle on (the push start button is supposed to pulse like the beating heart by the way), the steering column with lower and move towards you while the seat slides forward to your set seating position. The sequence is reversed when you get out of the vehicle. Really makes it feel like you're getting behind a X-Wing or something. Overall, I can't be happier with this All Season Sportscar. After about two years, it still brings a smile to my face every time I get behind the wheels, and I still catch myself admiring its lines.",5.0,"Impressive All Season Sportscar I would call the FX35 an All Season Sportscar (I wonder why Infiniti didn't call it that...).

As a techie, I didn't like the user interface, its not that intuitive. It has an aggressive look, and its fun to drive, but didn't like few features on the new one. See bellow.

In short, this car was definitely ahead of its time when it came out. The exterior design, while polarizing when first released, has held up to the test of time. I still get frequent compliments on the vehicle and when I tell them it's 8 years old they're in disbelief. The around view camera is a feature that makes it easy to maneuver into any spot that can fit the dimensions of the vehicle. The engine still runs strong with zero oil burn, an issue that has plagued this motor in other Infinitis. This car still hauls donkey when floored. The transmission was never great, sometimes it's slow to shift, but it's an issue I've had since brand new so I've learned to adapt to it. The interior has held up well, no bubbles on the dash (parked outside in the sun from 8a-5p at work), leather (maybe it's pleather?) has held up very well and all the interior lighting is still functional. Reliability wise, the engine wouldn't start once but that was due to a dirty intake, now they're cleaned at regular intervals of 15k miles.

Purchased a Hyundai Sonata, which is a great vehicle.  But it is not as much fun to drive as the V6 powered coupe, I had.  After looking more than a year, I found this 2004 Infiniti G35 with only 69,000 miles on it, via a referral.  Had it checked out by a well-respected mechanic.  Told me it was in excellent condition, but would eventually need one control arm and a valve cover gasket replacement.  Using that information, I got it for a steal at $4500.  Here's the main thing I don't like about it.  It sucks gas with an average mpg of about 23 miles per gallon.  Compared to the Hyundai's average of about 34mpg.  It was expected, but it is different when you notice that you are doing fill-ups more than once a week.  It is a little bit noisy, and you can easily hear the outsides sounds.  But the purr of the engine makes it worth it.  The good things though.  Being a 2004 G35, that was a year before a horsepower increase, so it readily accepts regular gasoline.  The accelerate is smooth and strong, a very slight tap on the gas at highway speed will have me up from 65 to 80+ in no time.  Unlike the Sonata, this G35 goes exactly where you point it, sometimes it gets there before you do.  It holds a curve perfectly at higher speeds, you don't have to worry about it jumping around, even on bumpy pavement.  The cabin size feels just right, but don't expect for adults to be super comfortable in the back.  Doing switchbacks in the nearby Smokey Mountains is absolutely fun.  Last of all, if you get a little bit too happy and hit the brakes, they drag the car down to a stop very quickly.  Visibility is pretty decent, too.  Here's the 'worst thing' about this car.  The infuriating entertainment system.  It has a cassette player, multi-disk cd player and of course am/fm.     The am/fm is horrible and with lots of static.  But the craziest thing is if you attempt to play the radio, cassette or cd player, while the AC/HEATER is on, the controls of the ac/heater and/or the entertainment system, will lock up.  When you have both on, you can't change the temperature or fan speed of the ac/heater, nor can you change the channel, the volume, the track, or the tone of the entertainment system.   All of the controls just lock at the setting that you had initially.  You have to actually shut the car off, then restart it, which will usually put one of the two things in off position.  A review of youtube found this to be a common problem because the ac/heater and entertainment system both use the same circuit board.  Putting in an aftermarket entertainment system usually solves the problem.  However,  because the radio is neither din or double din size, you must buy an aftermarket dashboard insert, which cost about $200, for essentially a piece of molded plastic.

For the first 100k I put very little money into it. Just oil changes, breaks, and tires. Then at 106k the transmission went. Figures 100k drive train warranty mine went at 106k. Dealership was great and found me a used Tranny for $3100 all in. That was a major expense but considering I hadn't had a car payment for 5 years I went for it.

I just replaced the rear suspension at 240k miles. I still have the same cad converter but did replaces muffler and pipes over 200k. I replaced belts, fluids, spark plugs but never any major engine issues. I have the sedan at 260hp and it's still a beast with pick up.

A bit of a risk for a significant G model generation change, but, it proved to be rewarding.  The 300+ hp will leave most cars gasping when you want to hit the accelerator.  The 5-spd sport stick is absolutely the sweet spot on a car this powerful (remember, the faster the track car, the LESS gears they require).  The newer 7 speeds are a gimmick.  The in-dash compact flash card (only year provided) is awesome (all of my music is on it and yes I download it all).  I am pretty tough on a car and this G35x has held up.  I do my own maintenance and it has been minimal.  Oil changes, tire rotations, and brakes is about it.  With nearly 100k miles on it, it has served me well.  So well, that I simply plan on keeping it even though I can afford a new car.  But why?  This thing drives as good as anything out there.  The only issue I have had are two:1. This car likes to drink fuel.  Despite the 25mpg avg, I would say I get closer to 19mpg.2. Although the tires have worn remarkably well for an AWD vehicle (still on the 2nd set), my right front wheel shows signs of inside tire cupping (and subsequent road noise).  I plan to put another set of tires on it and get the front end checked out; hopefully that takes care of that problem.Otherwise, I love the car.  The only reason for considering a new car is for some of the new technology that is out there such as blind spot monitoring and the 360 degree vision view (the 4 cameras).  Otherwise, I'm good.  Nissan's VQ engine won Ward's Automotive Award for about 10 years straight and this engine has performed flawlessly.  I suspect I'll need to change plugs soon, but, for now, it still runs like new (10 years later).For what it's worth, I am a Toyota man and have had Toyota trucks most of my life as well.  You can't go wrong with the Toyota/Lexus line either (although they have had some lemons like the IS250 direct port injection issue).  Infiniti/Nissan did a nice job with this car and I think the 2007 was the best year for reliability when you consider the transmission in this car (I'd want nothing more than 5 gears mated to this engine).

 on 10/24/16 02:57 AM (PDT),Joseph ,2005 INFINITI G35 Coupe Rwd 2dr Coupe (3.5L 6cyl 6M),"Beautiful, reliable, sports GT..."," I purchased this car in July of 2010 and have not regretted it for a single moment. I chose a diamond graphite coupe, 6MT revup, with black leather interior. I wanted a sports coupe that provided a sense of luxury and performance without breaking the bank.  When I purchased this car I was considering one of my long time favorites; the BMW E46 M3, along with the G37 coupe, and BMW 335i coupe. Though I knew both BMWs were better performers, I decided against them after extensive research that showed I would likely experience expensive regular maintenance and frequent, costly repairs. The G37 was also faster and had an upgraded, nicer interior, but the exterior left something to be desired for my taste. This car is extremely reliable, low cost maintenance, and loads of fun. I literally look forward to driving it every day. The G35 coupe is truly a beautiful car with a timeless design and I get compliments on it all the time from tuners, luxury car owners, to casual, young and old. I would argue it is one of Infiniti's best exterior designs. Concerning maintenance costs, this car has been great. I purchased it with 50k on the odometer and with it being a daily driver, it now has 166k on the odometer. My most expensive repairs have been replacing the clutch / flywheel at 150k and the power steering pump shortly after; both for under 2k... that's it! I had to replace the steering wheel clock spring and did it myself for around $50 dollars. (Used part) PROS... APPEARANCE - now this is of course completely based on ones preference, but I think this car is beautiful... and based on the feedback I get on almost a daily basis, the G35 is an aesthetically pleasing design, even by today's standards. It still holds its own next to the newest designs. It was truly innovative and groundbreaking at its debue and it still shows today with the timeless, classic lines, defining its motif. PERFORMANCE - fun, fun, fun... Strong, responsive engine. With 298hp it is not the fastest out there but still a competitive performer. This particular engine is shared with the 35th anniversary 350Z 300hp engine. The only difference in the intake assembly making a difference of about 2hp. With the 350Z 'Z tube' you get to the even 300hp mark.SOUND - the exhuast note is glorious (almost exotic) and coveted by many car enthusiasts. One of the best 6 cylinder exhaust notes around, especially in this price range. Most are either too raspy, high pitched or simply unheard. I get thumbs up all the time for the G's unique, tonal qualities. Pure bliss...RELIABILITY - The engine still runs like new and doesn't miss a beat. It does burn a little oil... about 1 quart every 3-5k between oil change intervals. PRACTICALITY - Great, especially considering it is a coupe. I have a 16 month old and a 3 month old and I can get them both in the back seat. (One forward facing and one rear facing child seat)  with plenty of room for myslef at 6ft. Trunk space is actually decent and the rear seats let down for larger items. Headroom is good up front, but the back not so much for taller passengers. CONS... RIDE COMFORT - don't expect a Cadillac /Benz plush ride. With the low stanced Nismo-tuned sport suspension, this car has a firm ride no doubt. I don't mind it much, but my wife and other passengers have stated it is less than desireable. It is smooth on the open highway, but does not absorb bumps and potholes well as you would expect from a 'luxury car'. It is slightly softer than the 350Z. NOISY Manual Transmission - On forums, the G35 and 350Z 6spd transmissions are often referred to as 'the rock crusher'. The clutch is noisy and chattery. You really notice it when sitting at drive thrus. Mine is even more noisy since I replaced the flywheel with a single mass, opposed to the oem dual mass. QUALITY / Materials - Interior materials are not the best but have held up well. An average mix of leather, plastics, and real aluminum trim that were fair and comparable for the mid 2000's. AUDIO / Electronics... The stereo sounds good but the interface is old and dated. I have since replaced it with a modern double-din touch screen that resolves this and many other technology related desires. TIRE WEAR - in its stock configuration, this car's camber setup eats up tires (inner wear) and does not have the adjustability needed to align for long wear. However, I purchased SPC's front and rear camber kit and can get a flat alignment that wears even for 40k. Anyway, I could get a lot more granular with this review but all things considered, I absolutely love this car. The pros outweigh the bad by multitudes. It has been a great car and I plan on keeping it for years to come. I am a detail enthusiast and take immaculate care of all vehicles I own, so I expect it to continue running and looking great. I would definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a classy, reliable,  grand tourer...",5.0,"Beautiful, reliable, sports GT...

 on 01/22/16 20:18 PM (PST),Former professional driver ,2005 INFINITI G35 Coupe Rwd 2dr Coupe (3.5L 6cyl 5A),"Beautiful, fast, reliable but..."," Bought this coupe used with only 24,000 miles on it. Loved the exterior styling and the handling (still do). It's been very reliable except the drivers side power window, but I only put about 7500 miles a year on the car.  The owners manual recommends premium gas but it will drive OK on regular. Bose sound system is fine. I don't have nav.  Climate control works great. Front seats are OK, but my wife complains about them and about getting out of the low seat. Not much knee room in back. Interior materials were never luxurious but still look nice. Trunk is a little small but the back seat folds down for extra cargo space.

This car is my daily driver.  It was in great condition and I really love the way this car drives. Especially, the roar of the muffler.  I had this vehicle toward the end of summer and now through the fall and winter. It handles well on dry and wet roads. I love the stiff suspension and the the heated seats, mirrors, power everything and cool features like the ability to (by factory remote) lower all four windows down at the same time as your walking towards your vehicle. This model came without the navigation system which was okay with me. So, I read a lot about these cars on various forums specific to the G35. Let me start off by saying my gas mileage was horrible initially. I was averaging about 14 mpg in the city and highway. So, I reset the trip computer by simply disconnecting the battery for over an hour which rest the computer. Afterward, I drove moderately around the city and on the highway. In other words, I didn't punch it at every single stop,etc... My mileage improved to over 20 mpg in the city and highway. The system adjusts itself to the driver. So, if you really push this car all the time you will get poor gas mileage. If you test it's ability on occasion you'll get good gas mileage. BTW, I suggest sticking with the premium gas. It's just better for performance.  Oil consumption happens with the engines as you get around 100k. It will burn about a quart of oil every 1,500-2000 miles. It's normal. Nothing to be alarmed about. I'm using conventional oil but will probably change to high mileage. Others use synthetic oil but I had a lot of leak issues with a Maxima when I turned to it. If your car hasn't been using synthetic I would suggest not using it when it has higher mileage. The brake issues heard about with these cars can be remedied by buying after market brakes and pads instead of the defective Nissan.  Overall, the car gives you the luxury and ride of a BMW and Mercedes at a fraction of the repair cost. After all, you're riding in a Nissan. A Nissan that was engineered to compete with those European cars. For a car thats 12 years old it's still gets looks. Now, it doesn't have usb ports so you'll have to add. I had to use a plug in phone holder through the cigarette lighter because there really isn't a good place to put your phone. And i have my usb port through it. Oh, and every instrument light in the car is amber color. Basically a light orange.  Some people hate it. Others like it or their indifferent to it. Personally, I think it's okay.I like the car too much to worry about something that trivial.  Nissan didn't make it all red because they didn't want to copy BMW and Mercedes. If you want a solid sedan with 280 horse power that won't be super expensive to fix, this is the vehicle for you. Keep in mind, with any used car you buy it's important to get one in good condition.

 on 08/03/16 06:48 AM (PDT),Andrew B ,2011 INFINITI QX56 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Sweet vehicle," So I have owned this vehicle now for 2+yrs (traded in a Cadillac Escalade); bought it used in 2014 with 28,000 miles and now have a little over 45,000 miles on it.  Thus far, love the vehicle, it handles very well, very comfortable and smooth both as driver and as a passenger.  Technology package on the vehicle is great.  Now a few of the issues that I have with the vehicle and I am comparing with my experiences with the two previous full size SUV's that I owned (2007 Yukon Denali and 2008 Cadillac Escalade) before purchasing the Infiniti QX-56 are: (1) Backup camera design is horrible.  Visibility is very terrible during the day if there is a lot of light coming into the car (very sunny day outside).  It is practically useless.  I have to look back and listen out for the parking sensors on bright sunny days.  At night time in very dark areas (no street or building lighting around), there is also very limited visibility using the backup camera (insufficient lighting).  I never had these problems with the backup camera with the Yukon Denali and Cadillac Escalade.  I had zero visibility issues both during the day and night regardless of how bright or dark it was.  In this area, GM has Infiniti beat by a long shot.  (2) Drivers and passenger side view mirrors should be able to fold in and out after the vehicle is turned off before the vehicle doors are open.  The battery should still hold a charge for about between 30 to 60 seconds.  If you forget to pull them in before turning off the vehicle, you have to start the car back up or turn on the ignition (hit the start button without stepping on the brakes).  Another feature I liked with the GM trucks I owned.  (3) Remote start should come standard with this vehicle since this is their flagship SUV.  Again, also another feature that I enjoyed with the GM trucks I owned.  (4) This is not really a big deal but the rear panel should be able to open and close in cases where you need to put something long (ladder) back there. (5) This too not really a big deal, but the third row seating should be more comfortable (should be able to fit an adult of average height and weight).  The Lincoln Navigator's (never owned but test drove and ridden in one quite a bit) third row seat is the best; there is literally no difference in comfort between the 2nd and 3rd row seats.",3.0,"Sweet vehicle So I have owned this vehicle now for 2+yrs (traded in a Cadillac Escalade); bought it used in 2014 with 28,000 miles and now have a little over 45,000 miles on it.

However, I bought it(2011 qx56) used at 43,000 miles and at 50,000 -60,000 it needed catalytic converter, air compressor, timing chain. Thankfully we had factory AND extended warranty that covered these repairs which probably came to over $10,000 in total. Then at about 65,000 a basketball bounced on the right hand passenger review mirror and broke it to wear it hung loose. It could not be repaired, had to replaced. A new one was $1200.00 (no warranty) because of the sensors and fancy camera it costs that much. Then when my battery died and left me stranded we went down the street bought another battery to replace it the car which evidently caused the fuse link to go bad so we had to get it towed $115, get a new fuse link $200 and after I picked it up went home and realized the headlights don't come on at all so now I have to go back AGAIN to get that fixed. Oh.....and after I picked it from getting one of the other major repairs done (it was winter and cold) and the service guys turned my heat on 90+ to help the freshly shampoo'd carpet to dry  which caused a huge crack in my windshield. So needless to say this car has been a beautifully driving headache. Not to mention the deprecitiation has gone down crazy. I have always owned Toyota, Acura, Honda. Will NEVER buy another Infiniti again. Beautiful cars and they drive great but they are not dependable as far as I have experienced.

I'm averaging just about 20mph city&highway without really pushing it. If you're planning on driving it (mine is the x version),in the snow I wouldn't recommend doing it with the factory Dunlop so-called all season tires. They are useless in the snow, and defeat the purpose of the new all wheel drive system. I replaced mine with the new Continental Extreme DWS's, and WOW...what a difference.

Never wrecked, nothing whatsoever wrong with it but for a door seal I had to replace.  I love this car, more power than you'll ever need, to the point of breaking the rear tires loose at 75mph on damp pavement when I stepped on it hard to change lanes and the VVT kicked in, YIKES!  You can pass anything at any time, and still get 26-28mpg hwy and 22 around town.  Handling is precise and crisp without being twitchy, and it handles curves on rails, very nice seat bolsters help too.  It rides great, firm, but not uncomfortable at all to my taste.  It's helped by smooth TN roads, up in the pothole, frost freeze northern states I may have another opinion.  Seats and interior are very comfortable for the long haul, with all the usual luxury.  Interior is also very quiet, which I love, not much road noise at all.  Now for a couple minor niggles, the cruise control is not all that accurate going up and down hills, picks up speed going down, then takes 3-5mph drop below set speed to kick back in.  Also the transmission has a pretty big lag between off throttle to back on engagement.  It will scare you the first time you time you slow down and jump back on it to turn in front of someone and it doesn't go!  I've gotten used to it and know how avoid it, so it's no big deal to me now.  The only other small thing missing is a headphone jack interface to play Pandora off my phone.  Bluetooth is only available on the navigation model, and there is a usb connection in the console which works with my IPOD, but I've never been able to figure out how to play Pandora through it.  There's also a hard drive you can copy your CD's onto, so there's really no shortage of music options.

It has loads of technology and aims to please the youthful buyers it attracts. It doesn't have the road presence of my much larger Yukon, but the trade off is easier parking, improved fuel economy, and better handling. The exhaust note is music to my ears with the right amount of V8 bark. It has generous seating for four adults and reasonable cargo space. The navigation is one of the best available. The dual climate control is first rate and the backup camera is essential due to poor rear visibility. Just mash the go fast pedal before you change lanes to be sure there isn't someone hanging out in the blind spots. Don't worry as it'll outrun, stop quicker, and out handle all but the absolute top performing car from each OEM. All that performance comes at the price of comfort. Premium materials help, but a sport oriented suspension will transmit bumps. Very communicative steering is far superior to the latest numb electronic steering units on newer cars. Parts are pricey as befitting a luxury brand, but the dealership experience is worth it.The latest update on this bionic cheetah is that it never feels cheap. Construction and high quality materials hold up very well. You'll be hard pressed to find a more reliable vehicle. The required premium fuel is the cost of performance. This isn't of any real concern for the targeted affluent buyers. As mentioned earlier the maintenance is quite high with stock twenty inch wheels and performance tires, large capacity oil changes, and well hidden service items which lead to higher labor costs if you have the dealership perform the work and you will want them to do just that. Infiniti was thoughtful enough to place an inspection plate that allows you to check the condition of the difficult to change air filter which I strongly suggest you replace with a long lasting premium reusable one. With our high snow fall totals this year it was easy to see that Infiniti did there homework with the AWD. When driven responsibly it moved in the direction you asked it too without drama. Much better than the old mechanical unit in my newer Yukon with aggressive tires. Is there anything this vehicle can't do well? Bruce Wayne should drive one of these. The one down side of this vehicle isn't a fault, but is the result of it's well known performance which leads to every boy racer to rev his little engine at a stop light hoping that you will stoop to his level and demonstrate what's underfoot. It can be quite annoying. Just turn the volume of the wonderful radio up a tad bit and you'll quickly forget he's there. Ah peace at last.The vehicle now has 118,500 and continues to impress. Several upgrades have been performed during normal maintenance further increasing its performance. The only issue is that the power door lock actuators are reluctant to cycle on very hot days. This is a well documented issue with a simple fix. Knowledgable enthusiasts cast envious looks with uncanny regularity. It's a shame Infiniti doesn't currently produce a V8 version of the G platform. Oh well guess I'll just have to hang onto this one.With fourteen years of sun exposure I can say that the dash it starting to show small bubbles. This is a quality complaint that several have noticed; an expensive one as well. The HVAC mode actuator has failed which causes a very loud popping noise when the system wants to recirculate. This requires changing it to fresh air and diminishes the system output. The drivetrain is superb and still provides impressive performance. The look has trickled down to several small crossovers including the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio so it's still modern even if not keeping with the edgier designs from it's parent company Nissan.The rear reclining seats are enjoyed by passengers and helps as the seats are sport firm. If you can find a used one with low mileage then buy it after checking for abuse and the obvious cosmetics.

Several upgrades have been performed during normal maintenance further increasing its performance. The only issue is that the power door lock actuators are reluctant to cycle on very hot days. This is a well documented issue with a simple fix. Knowledgable enthusiasts cast envious looks with uncanny regularity. It's a shame Infiniti doesn't currently produce a V8 version of the G platform. Oh well guess I'll just have to hang onto this one.With fourteen years of sun exposure I can say that the dash it starting to show small bubbles. This is a quality complaint that several have noticed; an expensive one as well. The HVAC mode actuator has failed which causes a very loud popping noise when the system wants to recirculate. This requires changing it to fresh air and diminishes the system output. The drivetrain is superb and still provides impressive performance. The look has trickled down to several small crossovers including the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio so it's still modern even if not keeping with the edgier designs from it's parent company Nissan.The rear reclining seats are enjoyed by passengers and helps as the seats are sport firm. If you can find a used one with low mileage then buy it after checking for abuse and the obvious cosmetics. It's a great alternative to a large SUV especially if you have a small family.","[('luxury brand', 'brand'), ('dealership experience', 'experience'), ('quality materials', 'materials'), ('premium fuel', 'fuel'), ('tad bit', 'bit'), ('system output', 'output')]","['high quality', 'fresh air', 'hold well', 'youthful buyers', 'required premium fuel', 'Just turn', 'forhe there', 'quickly forhe', 'wonderful radio']","[['road'], ['nt'], ['car'], ['one'], ['nt'], ['one'], ['car'], ['come'], ['nt', 'sport'], ['car', 'new', 'test'], ['test'], ['vehicle'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'work', 'one'], ['one'], ['year', 'home', 'work'], ['drive'], ['new'], ['drive', 'vehicle', 'one'], ['vehicle', 'one', 'now'], ['nt', 'vehicle'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'now'], ['nt'], ['nt', 'one'], ['year'], ['nt', 'one'], ['nt'], ['drive'], ['nt', 'new'], ['sport'], ['one'], ['great']]","[('road presence', 'presence'), ('fuel economy', 'economy'), ('exhaust note', 'note'), ('V8 bark', 'bark'), ('cargo space', 'space'), ('climate control', 'control'), ('materials help', 'help'), ('steering units', 'units'), ('inch wheels', 'wheels'), ('performance tires', 'tires'), ('capacity changes', 'changes'), ('oil changes', 'changes'), ('service items', 'items'), ('labor costs', 'costs'), ('inspection plate', 'plate'), ('air filter', 'filter'), ('s totals', 'totals'), ('fall totals', 'totals'), ('t homework', 'homework'), ('boy racer', 'racer'), ('stop light', 'light'), ('power door', 'door'), ('lock actuators', 'actuators'), ('V8 version', 'version'), ('G platform', 'platform'), ('sun exposure', 'exposure'), ('quality complaint', 'complaint'), ('HVAC actuator', 'actuator'), ('mode actuator', 'actuator'), ('popping noise', 'noise'), ('parent company', 'company'), ('reclining seats', 'seats'), ('seats firm', 'firm'), ('sport firm', 'firm')]","['blind spots', 'responsibly moved', 'absolute car', 'loud popping noise', 'bionic cheetah', 'reliable vehicle', 'thoughtful to place', 'further increasing', 'great alternative', 'still provides', 'poor visibility', 'very hot days', 'small bubbles', 'communicative steering', 'backup camera', 'expensive one', 'Several upgrades', 'dual climate control', 'Very communicative steering', 'hot days', 'well documented', 'normal maintenance', 'asked too', 'low mileage', 'rear visibility', 'envious looks', 'aggressive performance tires', 'well hidden', 'numb steering units', 'newer cars', 'then buy', 'do well', 'obvious cosmetics', 'even keeping', 'latest update', 'old unit', 'large SUV', 'hard pressed', 'higher labor costs', 'impressive performance', 'strongly suggest', 'electronic steering', 'little engine', 'better handling', 'well known', 'currently produce', 'first rate', 'fast pedal', 'generous seating', 'small crossovers', 'especially have', 'only issue', 'reluctant to cycle', 'edgier designs', 'right amount', 'affluent buyers', 'mentioned earlier', 'more reliable vehicle', 'several crossovers', 'simple fix', 'large capacity', 'long lasting', 'out handle', 'reasonable cargo space', 'small family', 'targeted buyers', 'never feels', 'rear reclining seats', 'stop quicker', 'real concern', 'Knowledgable enthusiasts', 'latest steering units', 'very loud popping noise', 'mechanical unit', 'easier parking', 'top car', 'uncanny regularity']",pos

 on 11/16/15 18:57 PM (PST),Rick Sparks ,2002 INFINITI Q45 Sedan 4dr Sedan (4.5L 8cyl 5A),Mr. Q45 Still Rocks," Back in the 90's, my wife & I bought a used '90 Q45, the first year of Infiniti's new sedan competitor to Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and Cadillac. All these years later, we remember that car with great affection - understated yet classy design, beautiful interior w. lots of room (but not too big), and for the owner who loves to drive, great suspension and ride combined with a world-class 4.5 liter V8 that loved to run. And all with Japanese reliability.Lately, we've thought a lot about that early Q. When it came time to replace my 150k mi. Mercedes E320, we chose a 79k mi. '02 Q45. The '02 was the first year of the 3rd generation, but everything about the earlier Q45 still applies. Best of all, the final series Q has no real weaknesses as a used-car buy; no air suspension to leak, no Northstar engine to fail, no complex electronics and no current dealers who hate to see an older Q come through the service bay. Our local Infiniti dealer treats my 14-year-old Q as if it were a new Q70.In searching for our '02, I discovered: 1) there are relatively few 3rd gen Q45s out there - Infiniti just didn't sell many new, and 2) most 3rd gen Q45s have accumulated over 100k miles. That said, I found a relatively low mile (79k) example about 100 mi. away w. great body/paint/interior and accident-free history. Service records are always a plus, but (sadly) not that common; a pre-purchase inspection is always a good idea, as is a search for customer (& BBB) ratings of the dealer you're buying it from.For the new owner of a used Q, the climate and audio controls on the 2002-2006 series require a bit of reading in the owner's manual, but are actually very logical (if not intuitive) and work fine. The interior design, especially the dash & center console, is both gorgeous and trend-setting; the current Q70 interior design is very similar. Large, supportive seats come complete with lumbar support for the driver & are the most comfortable of any car I've owned in 45 years of driving. That includes a healthy number of BMWs, Jags and Caddys.The Q45 was designed as a grand tourer in the European tradition - fast, comfortable & stylish transportation that can devour continents. Infiniti succeeded at a price that undercut their competitors by thousands. Although some regard the 3rd gen Q45 as somewhat quirky (headlight design, HVAC interface, transmission in permanent sport mode), the car's comfort, performance and space make it a true driver's car you can live with. You won't win any economy runs with it (20 mpg in mixed driving), and given the slightly numb steering, the Q is not exactly a canyon-carver, but it will get you there in a hurry with comfort & panache to spare. Those Gatling-gun headlights are the bomb, but be sure to follow the owner's manual suggestion to avoid turning the headlights on for very short periods; that apparently will burn out the ballast much faster, which is not cheap to replace (removal of the front bumper is required.)Maintenance is straightforward - just keep the 5W40 oil changed (synthetic, of course), put on a quality set of tires (I'm running new Pirelli P7s), and basically maintain it w. fresh coolant every 3 years or so, good brake pads and new engine air & cabin air filters once a year. And don't skimp on using recommended premium fuel - that thoroughbred 4.5 liter V8 will be much happier. Keep it clean & enjoy the fact that you own one of the world's great super sedans: the Q45.UPDATE: Six months in, I'm still happily driving my '02 Q45, albeit after investing some money to bring it up to standard mechanically & cosmetically. I decided to spend $200 at my local Infiniti dealer to update the transmission software to make the throttle more responsive; they also replaced the electronic accelerator pedal w. a new design. After the upgrade, the throttle response is much better, although the transmission remains prone to stay in a lower gear too long when accelerating at anything other than a leisurely rate; it's as if it's in permanent ""sport"" mode. I also had the dealer change the transmission fluid/filter ($100) & do a proper 4-wheel alignment ($90). After the alignment, the car tracks/feels much better now going down the road.I also spent $500 to have the front bumper removed & professionally refinished/painted; the original paint was wearing 80k miles' worth of scrapes & scratches. Other expenses since purchase include new Pirelli P7s, new brake discs/pads front & rear and a new cabin air filter.  UPDATE #2: Our Q45 has accumulated 13,000 miles of daily driver use in a year with zero repair costs & no problems. Average 20.4 MPG in mixed driving; oil consumption averages 1 quart/5k mi., which seems normal from everything I've read about this engine.

And what a difference it made. No more hesitation on takeoff.  The first part of the fix replaces the accelerator pedal with one with a bit less lag in the pedal itself. Nice update. Good update.

The M37  is so dependable that it's recommended as a used luxury car by CR. It's a perfect blend of  reliability, performance and luxury. Before  I bought the M37 I drove both the Mercedes E350 2 door Sport and BMW 5 series. I was not impressed. Both offered cachet names but not much else for the high price. The BMW was not the BMW of my father's generation. The handling was lackluster and the interior was high grade plastic and vinyl (seats).

I have had it for 10 months and driven in snow, rain and dry conditions.  Mountains and flat ground.  The thing has been great in all conditions, even in a mini blizzard!  You have to watch the throttle in bad weather, or use the economy or snow modes but otherwise it handles great.  I find myself going over the limit a bit more often when accelerating on an on-ramp, it just gets to speed so quickly if you aren't paying attention, even faster if you have it in sport or sport+ mode.  I typically drive around in standard mode.  I initially used the economy mode but realized it didn't seem to make a big difference in fuel economy.  Speaking of, I average 22-24 MPG with a good mix of city and highway.  I play with the speed a bit but I'm not racing every car I pull up next to at a stop light either.  I have had it back to the dealer three times.  First was for the Bluetooth system.  It would not connect properly to my old LG G4 even though they advertised it would.  They went through the Bluetooth system and couldn't find anything and finally told me to go away that there wasn't anything they could do for me.  Now with my new (Samsung S8) there haven't been any issues.  Second trip was for the first oil change.  Third trip was due to a notice I got in the mail about a computer re-programming (no big deal).  Otherwise I haven't had any issues.  I was a littler nervous about the run flat tires and no spare.  I got a nail in one of the tires and saw that it was $465/tire for the OEM tires.  Luckily the nail didn't puncture the air chamber and I didn't have to replace the tire.  There are cheaper run flats but I have been impressed with the tires, not sure I want to spend that for replacement tires when that time comes.

The Bluetooth was useless, it went through brakes pretty fast and gas mileage wasn't great, but other than that it was a great car.  So, when it was time to get a new car, I bought the first model year of the Q50 hybrid.  Over the life of the car the drive-by-wire steering failed, the audio system never worked properly, the Bluetooth was useless, the transition from electric to gas was very rough, the gas engine would suddenly rev up while sitting at a stop light shaking the car, the car would actually speed up if you didn't push down on the brake hard enough, the car would shudder when accelerating out of a turn with neither gas nor electric engine knowing what to do and the mud flaps kept falling off.

It's a 2014 and I bought it in mid 2015. I average about 60 miles per day. Here are the problems: 1 - about 8 months after I bought the car so in 2016, I noticed the window button having cracked. Doesn't affect the use, but I feel the crack every time I go to use it. Shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car. 2 - in late 2016, the driver side window started making a horrid squealing sound when it gets wet and it's opened/closed. Again...shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car. 3 - the back seat row has the middle foldable cup holder that comes out of the back and behind it is a piece of what seems like a sturdy piece of plastic fold-able piece separates the trunk and the seat when the cup holders are down. Well this broke and came out the second time the cup holder was used. Shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car in my humble opinion. 4 - at about 59,500 miles the check engine light came on and upon starting the car excessive white smoke comes out of the exhaust. Made appointment with dealership and after 6 hrs they can't find ANYTHING wrong other than it's about 4 quarts low on oil and it needs back breaks. They must have reset the check engine light. A week later, engine light comes back on and I take it back to dealer at 60,003 miles. This is where magic happens. An hour into sitting at the dealer, they discover the engine is so full of sludge that I just plain and simple need a new engine. It's worth to point out that bumper-to-bumper expires at 60,000 miles.  Amazing. Now we have to argue that we should not pay for the engine. It was brought in while under bumper-to-bumper and really, a new engine shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car!! Of course I'm being accused of not changing oil frequently enough, however they will be receiving receipts to prove that I've done my part. 5 - 4 months ago I had the back brakes changed and now are being told I urgently need new brakes again. Should break pads wear down in 4 months? Never owned a car where the breaks wear in 4 months and my driving habits/patterns hasn't changed much in the past 15 years. 5 - the back up camera doesn't always work. Some days it just chooses to be black until next start up. For me, these are too many problems for a car in this price range. I have owned a Nissan Xterra and a QX80 and I have loved the durability and quality, but this car has made me skeptic of the brand and quality. I buy my cars and I keep them for years.

The front seats are soft on my butt and legs, WAAAAY better than our Mercedes GLK 350 which literally cause me pain in about 5 minutes of driving it.  I find the electronics intuitive, without the need to read a manual, which is totally different from my wife's 2014 Mercedes.  I love, love, love to drive this car.   The suspension is for driving fast in canyons, not to be confused for a fluffy marshmallow that you get in other luxury road cars. It handles bumps decently, about as good as my wife's Mercedes GLK 350, maybe even a little better. The MPG is reflective of the fact that Infiniti is squeezing EVERY bit of horsepower that they can out of this engine. If you want MPG, you need to get the Nissan Altima version of this car with 60 less horsepower.  The slow booting of the BlueTooth is mildly annoying, but I get to listen to that great exhaust note in the meantime :-) .  It has a nice little rumble when you start it up. This car was manufactured in 2014, so it may have less problems than those that were ""2014"" actually manufactured in 2013 (I hope).  I live in UT and have to drive up a steep, snowy hill in the wintertime that my FWD Camry barely makes on some days. I didn't want an SUV, which are more expensive anyway, and the price point was $12,000 dollars less than an AWD V6 Lexus.  I bought this as a Certified and bought the extended warranty, because I didn't want to pay when expensive electronics fail and I knew that Infiniti isn't as reliable as my Toyota's.  Caveat:  I've owned this less than a week, I can only speak about driving the car and nothing about reliability. The AC compressor started to howl when the climate control was on and they replaced it for a new one.  Within 3 months, it started to make noise again and it's getting louder so I will get it replaced again. If money wasn't an issue, I would have bought a Lexus GS.  If money isn't an issue with you, I would recommend that you buy a Lexus because the reliability will be light years ahead of this.6 month update. I've put about 7k miles on it with a couple long road trips.  I still looooove driving this car and I giggle whenever I stomp on the throttle (which I do all the time).

My wife and I wanted a 4 door sedan because we already had the Explorer Sport (large SUV). I bought the 2014 and wanted the '15 because of the so so rating s on the '14 Q50... but this car was too good of a deal to pass up because it only had 6K miles on it (Bought Used -  prior owner only leased). I have not had any issues with the car since I have owned it ( 1+ Year.)    The biggest complaint about this car on these reviews has been the electronics...GOOD NEWS! there is a software update for the electronics.. however it still has some really minor bugs.  Example: When you start up the car its takes my car approximately 43-46 seconds for the apps to load. With this includes the rear camera ""drive aid"" lines. So if you hop in your car you can still use the reverse camera but the ""drive aid"" lines wont show up until your car software has loaded which again takes almost 1 minute. So this is occasionally annoying but not enough for me to hate the car. Other than that, the layout of the electronic is really nice. I am a simple guy who wanted a sharp looking car that had some kick to it ( this car definitely has some speed to it). I also wanted a car that when you sit in it, you are impressed by the look of the dash and the display which the double screens is really sharp. The one real knock I would have on the car is the lack of storage. Also, if you are over 6 foot - this car may be too tight for you but still check it out. I'm 5'11 (200lbs) and feels good but at times a little cramped.  I'm not just talking about the trunk, I am talking about in the cabin too. the glove compartment is really small and the armrest storage is not deep at all. Also, the baby seat fits in the car but isn't as tight as I would personally like it... then again we take the Explorer for most long trips with the kids...Summary really fun car to drive and I wouldn't stress too hard on the electronics.",4.0,"Good car  - Researched a ton before buying!

I, like others, was worried about the acceleration, with this being a turbo driven(?), smaller engine.  While I think perhaps this new one might have a little less grunt if you're already going 40 or 60, off the line, this thing is like a vomit-inducing rocket.  There's a turbo?--I sure can't tell.  Yes, the steering is a bit wonky at first but I think I might grow to like it--as of right now I'm ambivalent about it.  It's like it fights your initial move on the wheel and then slightly keeps it where you move it.  Weird.  I haven't really had a chance to test them out but the brakes don't feel quite as utterly and mind-blowingly amazing as they were on my g35x.  Those things were absolutely ridiculous though.  I don't think I ever put my foot all the way to the floor.  These ones feel a lot more civilized but I think if you do put your foot to the floor that's when they'd really clamp down?  We shall see.  The interior is mostly a work of art--I'm SO glad they changed the colors away from that amber/orange color (gross).  However the dual screens are kinda weird.  I hope there's a way to just turn off the GPS screen (haven't found it yet), 'cause I'd rather not have it on all the time.  I also think it's pretty bizarre that you can't change the default driving mode (I have actually verified this one).  I'd much rather have it start up in Eco and what's the point of having a personalized driving mode if you have to click three times to get to it each time you start up the car?  Also seems strange that they don't have a main mid display mode that shows current MPH (that could be one thing I just haven't found yet, but I've definitely toggled through all the screen options.)

I haven't really had a chance to test them out but the brakes don't feel quite as utterly and mind-blowingly amazing as they were on my g35x.  Those things were absolutely ridiculous though.  I don't think I ever put my foot all the way to the floor.  These ones feel a lot more civilized but I think if you do put your foot to the floor that's when they'd really clamp down?  We shall see.  The interior is mostly a work of art--I'm SO glad they changed the colors away from that amber/orange color (gross).  However the dual screens are kinda weird.  I hope there's a way to just turn off the GPS screen (haven't found it yet), 'cause I'd rather not have it on all the time.  I also think it's pretty bizarre that you can't change the default driving mode (I have actually verified this one).  I'd much rather have it start up in Eco and what's the point of having a personalized driving mode if you have to click three times to get to it each time you start up the car?  Also seems strange that they don't have a main mid display mode that shows current MPH (that could be one thing I just haven't found yet, but I've definitely toggled through all the screen options.)  Anyways, those are very minor gripes.  So far this car is a dream...

Coming off of a 2013 Infiniti M37xS lease (Q70 S AWD in modern nomenclature), I was looking to downsize. I leased the M37, a very large car, opportunistically because Infiniti had a great lease deal on the loaded models, but the truth is that I liked my G37s much better. The convincing came after driving some tough competition in the form of a BMW 340i and Audi S4, both of which I liked for various reasons. The first car I test drive was actually a Q60 Red Sport coupe loaded up with the DAS steering and all sorts of active safety tech. The interior was red with optic white trim. it was gorgeous. The car fast, composed, and a lot of fun. The steering was good, but still a bit video-gamey for my tastes. I had to deactivate much of the electronic safety wizardry because it drove me nuts. The next car was what I fell in love with; a Q50 Red Sport sedan, black on black, with only the Premium Plus package and a couple other select options added on to the standard Red Sport goodies. The black with the dark gray 19"" rims is a badass look and the black interior with the textured shodo aluminum trim is much more sporty than the wood interior treatment. The best part - besides the bonkers engine - is that the standard steering with electric-assist is MUCH better than the DAS, but still offers a couple of different settings. What won me over was the the combination of how the car drives and that I liked the interior and in-car tech better in the Infiniti. The first impression that you get when driving a Red Sport is that the engine is an absolute monster. I've owned and driven some fast cars and I think 400hp is under-rating this engine. It could be that it feels even faster because the torque comes on so early (1500) with a broad peak (6200) and that the AWD variant I have delivers all of that power at any time, but wow...this thing HAULS! The drive modes (SNOW, ECO, Standard, Sport, Sport+, Personal) significantly alter the personality of the car. SNOW mode is for the deep stuff. It essentially locks the car into 50/50 split and softens torque application, ECO actively resists aggressive driving and is perfect when driving elderly relatives, Standard mode softens the suspension, steering, throttle, and shifts and is perfect for general cruising, Sport makes the suspension stiffer, steering quicker, and everything feel much more aggressive, Sport + mode is hooligan mode and dials back the traction control. Personal mode allows individual settings for Steering, Suspension, Shifts/Throttle (I like everything dialed up expect standard suspension for highway driving, for instance). In all modes not SNOW or ECO, the Red Sport wants to run. I've already logged 4.48s 0-60 run and 12.95 quarter at 109.1mph according to Vbox in my limited testing. The interior is technically impressive with it's 2 touch screens and 3rd color screen between the gauges. Some complain that the InTouch system is difficult to use, but after a short time it becomes second nature. The app connectivity is beyond pathetic (only Facebook Check-in and Events, and Google Online Search apps) and is waaaay behind the competition, and the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is shocking, the bluetooth and USB connectivity, the easy-to-use navigation system, and the solid design of the overall interface make it a positive experience. The Bose 14 speaker XM/HD Radio/FM/AM system is impressive and is superior to any of the other Bose systems I've experienced in other Infiniti vehicles. It was also the best audio system of the cars I test drove. Overall, the interior is very comfortable with soft leather and high quality switchgear everywhere you touch. This Q50 has the G37 character that I felt the 2014 model lacked. It's aggressive and always wants to attack the next straightaway, curve, or onramp. The engine sound is addictive and it'll pin you back in your seat. Check this one out if you want a true performance sleep that also happens to be a heck of a value.",5.0,"The Ultimate Sleeper Sedan The Q50 Red Sport 400 needed to convince me to buy it...and it did.

It seems everyday I see or feel something else of a positive note on this car.

This car drifts in a very confident and positive fashion.  I am still quite glad I chose this car.  If you are a driver's driver, you should try this car.  In this price range, I consider this a better value than competitors like BMW.  Truth:  19 inch tires, upgraded brakes, Premium, RWD drive.  I purposedly chose the NON drive by wire, as I had a really BAD experience with another Infiniti that had drive by wire.  The NON drive by wire, has excellent road manners, great steering control and road feel, great shift points, and wonderful braking.  I find myself in tight turns still able to make micro shifts to the curve such that the line I have picked out is more efficiently used.  (It took 1200 miles and 3 months to get to the present performance and appreciation for my part)  Though there are two taller gears than the Coupe model, I find the accleration and shift points to be more than adequate.Though others have found the dual electronics screen distracting, I have found the opposite.  With most things you need to do, like change the audio device or radio station, there are 2 or 3 ways to get it done.

It had all of the options we wanted (AWD, strong power, look of luxury) so we opted for the new model instead of the outgoing G model.  Overall the car is great with the exception of electronic systems that are the center piece of the interior.  I have never seen a car's systems take so long to come online.  Once you start the car, at best, all of the radio functions will finally become available after about 30 seconds to a minute.  Also (and I find this to be hazard that Infiniti should fix), the back-up sensors and grid also take about 30 seconds to a minute to become available.  When you are in a crowded shopping area and your first action when leaving is to back out of the parking spot, all safety systems should be immediately available.  Our other car's (not an Infiniti) backup systems, radio and all other electronics are immediately available at the turn of the ignition.  Even when the electronics are available, the Q50 has several glitches.  When we first got the car, the radio would ""freeze"", meaning once you turned to a station, you could not switch stations or even turn the volume down without stopping the car, turning it off and restarting.  I think they finally fixed that issue with one of the several updates, but we still have glitches in the radio and controls from time to time.  I think the Q50's navigation system is significantly better than the one in our other car and is extremely user-friendly and easy to use while driving.Overall a good car with impressive power, comfort and other features, but as a new model, it has some needed improvements that likely will not be available for another model year or two.

 on 12/17/15 16:08 PM (PST),Feng Guo ,2015 INFINITI Q40 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.7L 6cyl 7A),2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD causes me tinnitus and heari," I bought this new 2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD from Beshoff Infiniti (San Jose) on Feb 28, 2015. After driving this noisy car for three months, or about 3000miles, I started having ringing in both ears (tinnitus). It became more and more obvious after I drove this Q40, and I have trouble to sleep since then. I also start losing my hearing in both ears, especially for the low voice from a meeting in a group or in a noisy environment, or someone with bass voice in the phone. I have contacted Beshoff Infiniti in June 2015 when I noticed the tinnitus caused by the noise.  They refused to take the car back with full refund and claimed that itâs normal car noise. I took my doctorâs suggestion to wear earplugs when driving this Q40 since then. After another 6 months of driving (total mileage is 10,000miles now), the tinnitus and my hearing didnât get better, and itâs boring me a lot, both in my life and work. I contacted the dealer and the car maker again this month. They asked me to do a second road test and still claimed that itâs normal road noise. But this ânormalâ noise is killing me and I donât think I can drive this car anymore. Because the dealer and Infiniti refused to help me with the problem, I did some noise tests and analysis myself, to figure out whatâs going on. According to the result from Adobe Audition CC, a professional audio analysis software, the noise mainly from 100-400 Hz, that is the low frequency noise not sensitive to human being. This means, even if the driver didnât hear the noise, the energy carried by this sounds will still go through the ear and damage the auditory nerve cells without immediate impact. The symptom is, you may not hear a loud noise (at 6000-8000Hz), but your ears are in the pain. The low frequency noise of this Q40 AWD carried much higher energy than another model made by Infiniti, the Q50, at this range. This indicates that the company has the technology and capability to reduce the noise, but they did not apply it to Q40 for some reason. I am in the progress of negotiation with Infiniti regional affair manager now. Infiniti remains to claim itâs the normal noise, and because it not the defect on any part of the vehicle, they cannot repair it or give a full refund as I requested, neither the compensation to the health damage on me. With no concern on the fact that this noise already caused severe and permanent health damage to the customer, Infiniti refuse to recall the cars and investigate the potential harm of the noise to the customers. Itâs always difficult for individual to negotiate and reach desired outcome with the big company.  So far, total 8574 of Infiniti Q40 were sold in U.S. since Jan 2015 ( Infiniti sales stats: http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2011/01/infiniti-g-sales-figures.html, the sales dropped from 1000 to 38 by Nov. 2015 ).  All these customers may suffer from the same noise. Some of them may have family members riding with them, including children. As a Ph.D. in Biology, I am aware that the auditory nerve cells are the only type of cell that cannot regenerate in human body. Once you lose the hearing, you lose it permanently. The public should be alerted that there is potential risk to drive this car, for both the current Q40 owners and the potential buyers.

 on 06/25/18 06:45 AM (PDT),Adam stein ,2013 INFINITI JX SUV JX35 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),"Great Value, hard to beat"," Bought used with 30k miles. Now we have 80k trouble free miles. We bought fully loaded including TVs for the kids. Upgraded to this when we had twins from EX35. Did the whole Acura MDX, Infiniti JX35 comparison. We needed something with 3 rows in case grandparents came along and we needed plenty of space for the twins stuff. My wife didnât feel comfortable driving something as large as a Tahoe/Yukon and Lexus only offered 3 rows on a truck based platform with a stupidly designed 3rd row that flipped up to the side and chewed up valuable cargo space. After test driving both Acura and Infiniti we realized the Infiniti is significantly larger, offered a nicer cabin (in our opinion) and rode more comfortably. 4 years and nearly 50k miles later, we are just as happy as when we first bought it. No major mechanical issues. Reliability has been top notch, although I understand that reliability has not been Infinitiâs strong suit as of late, we have been lucky on our JX. The interior has held up extremely well considering my twins have given it all theyâve got.  Now weâve just added a 3rd kid and with 3 kids in car seats, we need to upgrade in size.

Now we have 80k trouble free miles. We bought fully loaded including TVs for the kids. Upgraded to this when we had twins from EX35. Did the whole Acura MDX, Infiniti JX35 comparison. We needed something with 3 rows in case grandparents came along and we needed plenty of space for the twins stuff. My wife didnât feel comfortable driving something as large as a Tahoe/Yukon and Lexus only offered 3 rows on a truck based platform with a stupidly designed 3rd row that flipped up to the side and chewed up valuable cargo space. After test driving both Acura and Infiniti we realized the Infiniti is significantly larger, offered a nicer cabin (in our opinion) and rode more comfortably. 4 years and nearly 50k miles later, we are just as happy as when we first bought it. No major mechanical issues. Reliability has been top notch, although I understand that reliability has not been Infinitiâs strong suit as of late, we have been lucky on our JX. The interior has held up extremely well considering my twins have given it all theyâve got.  Now weâve just added a 3rd kid and with 3 kids in car seats, we need to upgrade in size.

Performance: The engine is adequate and the ride is more luxurious than it is sporty. For 90% of drivers in this class, it will perform admirably.Plows quite bit into the turns, but this isn&#146;t a M series. Interior:Top notch interior.Seats are firm, but comfortable.I am a large guy over 6 feet, and I can fit in all three rows. The 3rd row would be tough for long periods, but doable for less than an hour.The 3rd row access entry space is big enough for an adult to gain access within to much trouble. Technology:It may take a year or more to get your hands around all of the features.The basic functions are intuitive, but like a really powerful smart phone, the vehicleÂs capabilities likely far exceed the userÂs mastery of the systemÂs functionality.The steering wheel controls are reversed from most vehicles, and the different interfaces will take a little while to familiarize myself with being a distraction.Non-Critical, but Quirky Issues:Due to the push-button keyless ignition, there doesnÂt appear to be a way to energize the vehicle control systems within starting the vehicle first.There doesnÂt appear to be a way to roll up and down windows, or play radio like you would with a vehicle in Âaccessory mode with a traditional turn-key ignition.There is a very poorly placed ÂSOSÂ button for the Infiniti Connect emergency notification system.The button is located on the overhead control panel, approximately Â½-inch below the button for the driver-side overhead lamp.When the headlines are engaged, the button is back-lighted, but is easily confused with the overhead light switch in the dark.Yes, I pushed it accidentally on the first evening I drove the car. The response came from Infiniti in approximately 30 seconds and the call center representative was thankfully very understanding.While the odds of changing a tire yourself is remote with roadside assistance, the rear Bose Direct-Wave speaker and plastic rear hatch liner would need o be removed prior to accessing the under-body high pressure spare tire and jack.Remote start will not work with second key located inside of within close proximity of the vehicle.Once the second key was removed from the car, it started right up.While the DVD playing in the back can be viewed on the front heads-up monitor, the car must be stopped and the emergency break engaged before it will come up.No CD changer, but rather a hard drive storage system where you can burn hundreds on CDs onto prior to leaving.Unclear if the burn function works with audio books.Overall:I think Acura is going to have to re-design the MDX this year to match the JX35 main buying demographic.The bar has been raised in that price class.While not perfect and bordering on being too technologically complex, the JX35 hits or exceeds expectations for factors that matter to the 40-something $100K+ income female.",4.625,"First Impressions Just took delivery of our emerald graphite JX35 AWD (fully loaded) with java brown interior.My first impressions are as follows:Appearance:As attractive as the JX35 appears in the photos, the vehicle looks even better in person.The exterior styling is very sporty without looking gimmicky.The dark plastic aeroskirts and underbody accents compliment the lines well.While the salesman admitted he was skeptical of the java interior with the dark gray dash and emerald graphite color scheme when we pre-ordered, but was very impressed when it was delivered.The dark brown leather looks very luxurious and breaks up what would be a monochromatic look.ItÂs definitely one of the smartest looking SUVs on the road today.

The response came from Infiniti in approximately 30 seconds and the call center representative was thankfully very understanding.While the odds of changing a tire yourself is remote with roadside assistance, the rear Bose Direct-Wave speaker and plastic rear hatch liner would need o be removed prior to accessing the under-body high pressure spare tire and jack.Remote start will not work with second key located inside of within close proximity of the vehicle.Once the second key was removed from the car, it started right up.While the DVD playing in the back can be viewed on the front heads-up monitor, the car must be stopped and the emergency break engaged before it will come up.No CD changer, but rather a hard drive storage system where you can burn hundreds on CDs onto prior to leaving.Unclear if the burn function works with audio books.Overall:I think Acura is going to have to re-design the MDX this year to match the JX35 main buying demographic.The bar has been raised in that price class.While not perfect and bordering on being too technologically complex, the JX35 hits or exceeds expectations for factors that matter to the 40-something $100K+ income female.","[('Seats firm', 'firm'), ('3rd row', 'row'), ('Â\x93SOSÂ\x94 button', 'button'), ('emergency notification', 'notification'), ('notification system', 'system'), ('light switch', 'switch'), ('price class', 'class')]","['easily confused', 'overhead light switch', 'poorly placed', 'b3rd rown leather', 'large guy', 'long periods', 'monochromatic look', 'back lighted']","[['nt'], ['vehicle'], ['sport'], ['nt', 'ski'], ['nt'], ['one', 'road', 'test'], ['sport'], ['drive'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['nt'], ['year', 'take'], ['nt', 'like', 'vehicle', 'one'], ['nt', 'vehicle', 'take'], ['nt', 'vehicle'], ['like', 'vehicle'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['nt', 'car'], ['nt', 'second'], ['road'], ['vehicle', 'work', 'second'], ['car', 'second'], ['nt', 'come', 'car'], ['drive', 'nt'], ['audi', 'work'], ['year', 'think'], ['come']]","[('plastic aeroskirts', 'aeroskirts'), ('underbody accents', 'accents'), ('graphite scheme', 'scheme'), ('color scheme', 'scheme'), ('M series', 'series'), ('notch interior', 'interior'), ('row access', 'access'), ('access entry', 'entry'), ('entry space', 'space'), ('vehicleÂ\x92s capabilities', 'capabilities'), ('systemÂ\x92s functionality', 'functionality'), ('steering wheel', 'wheel'), ('wheel controls', 'controls'), ('Quirky Issues', 'Issues'), ('button ignition', 'ignition'), ('vehicle control', 'control'), ('control systems', 'systems'), ('overhead control', 'control'), ('control panel', 'panel'), ('driver side', 'side'), ('overhead lamp', 'lamp'), ('call center', 'center'), ('center representative', 'representative'), ('roadside assistance', 'assistance'), ('Wave speaker', 'speaker'), ('hatch liner', 'liner'), ('sp tire', 'tire'), ('emergency break', 'break'), ('CD changer', 'changer'), ('drive storage', 'storage'), ('storage system', 'system'), ('burn function', 'function'), ('100K+ female', 'female'), ('income female', 'female')]","['dark dash', 'much trouble', 'most vehicles', 'front heads', 'high pressure', 'traditional button ignition', 'far exceed', 'first evening', 'started up', 'looking SUVs', '3rd entry space', 'key button ignition', 'really powerful phone', 'Remote start', 'main buying', 'Overall think', 'keyless button ignition', 'hard drive', 'pushed accidentally', 'removed prior', 'different interfaces', 'smart phone', 'plastic hatch liner', 'powerful phone', 'close proximity', 'second key', 'gray dash', 'audio books', 'little while', 'basic burn functions', 'perform admirably', 'dark plastic aeroskirts', 'smartest SUVs', 'starting first', 'Top notch', 'userÂ\x92s mastery', 'exterior styling', 'first impressions', 'compliment well', 'Just took', 'emerald graphite', 'rear hatch']",pos

 on 06/10/16 16:54 PM (PDT),Craig Elford ,2015 INFINITI QX80 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Great Infiniti QX80 Ownership Experience," My 2015 QX80 is my second Infiniti full size SUV as I previously drove a 2006 QX56 which I still own as a third vehicle for our family.  I put over 205,000 miles on the 2006 model, and had absolutely no problems.  Great quality vehicle with outstanding ownership experience.  When it came time to look at new vehicles I again did rigorous evaluation before purchasing my 2015 QX80.  I looked at the Ford Expedition (I previously owned a 1997 model), the Lincoln Navigator (my wife drives a 2006 model), the Cadillac Escalade, the GMC Yukon Denali, the Chevy Tahoe LTZ, and the Toyota Sequoia Platinum.  I am 6'-8"" and immediately eliminated the Toyota Sequoia as I could not even sit in the driver seat due to the very short headroom as my head hit the ceiling even with the seat back reclined pretty significantly.  I loved the legroom and headroom for all the GM products as they had best in class legroom, but GM still has not engineered a decent 3rd row seat to fold flat into the floor.  While they advertise the new versions that way, in reality you lose at least 4"" in the height of the cargo area as they have artificially raised the cargo floor to accommodate the third row seating when folded down.  Legroom on their 3rd row seating was basically unusable.  That left the Lincoln Navigator and the Ford Expedition, but there was simply no comparison when evaluating the quality of the vehicles between the Infiniti QX80 and the Ford and Lincoln products.  I have been extremely pleased with the outstanding quality of my QX-80.  With 400 horsepower it has plenty of power to provide effective performance for such a large, heavy vehicle.  While it does not have sports car acceleration, if you are driving a full size SUV that is not a primary consideration.  I have found the 5.6 liter engine to have plenty of power and zip and even when cruising at 70 mph there is still plenty of acceleration when you need to pass.  The 315 horses available on my 2006 QX56 was adequate, and the new fuel injection on the QX80 provides a noticeable difference in power.  The greatest improvements in with the QX-80 is in the changes made with technology to improve the ride and to make the driving experience safer.  I have found the blind spot monitor to be a tremendous help, and the intelligent cruise control is an amazing technology to monitor what is happening with vehicles ahead of you to ensure safe distances are maintained.  If you have not used this technology, you will love it as you can set the interval you are looking to maintain and the sensors on the vehicle do an amazing job of monitoring not only the vehicle immediately in front of you, but also the vehicle on ahead to determine if there is a potential safety hazard and will automatically adjust the set speed accordingly.The driving and passenger ride experience is incredibly comfortable.  With the long wheel base, the quality of the seats, and the suspension system provides a luxury car ride for your passengers.  I get so many compliments from those riding with me as to how incredibly comfortable the ride is as well as how impressed they are with the luxury finish.  Infiniti has used very high quality materials and it is very evident in the look and feel of the vehicle.  Even with the size of a full size SUV, the QX80 handles incredibly well for both highway driving, city driving, and the surround view cameras and sensors make it every easy to handle vehicle even in tight spaces.  Turning radius is excellent for this size vehicle and I can actually U-turn in a much smaller radius than many passenger cars.  This vehicle is a dream to drive on the highway as the ride is so comfortable, yet when needed the handling is very responsive.  Another great advantage to a full size SUV is the amount of cargo you can haul in the cargo area behind the 2nd row, and if necessary with the second row captain seats folded down.  I have hauled an incredible amount of gear in my vehicle multiple times over the past 27 months and having the voluminous cargo area is great.  This is where it is so important at the elegant engineering of how the 3rd row seating folds into the floor.While I would agree with the other two reviews listed regarding the low end of the gas gauge accuracy, and at times the shifting of the transmission could be smoother, but that is only when you are really pushing the vehicle and need to accelerate quickly.  Overall, to me these are very small issues compared to the overall quality and experience of owning this vehicle.  The QX80 also has unique styling which you may either love or hate, but you won't look like every other full size SUV on the road.  I personally really like the styling as it is not just a square box like so many of the competitors.The net is, I love my 2015 Infiniti QX80, and would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.  We have been so impressed with my QX80 we purchased a new 2017 QX60 for my wife to replace her old vehicle. She loves it!",5.0,"Great Infiniti QX80 Ownership Experience My 2015 QX80 is my second Infiniti full size SUV as I previously drove a 2006 QX56 which I still own as a third vehicle for our family.  I put over 205,000 miles on the 2006 model, and had absolutely no problems.  Great quality vehicle with outstanding ownership experience.  When it came time to look at new vehicles I again did rigorous evaluation before purchasing my 2015 QX80.  I looked at the Ford Expedition (I previously owned a 1997 model), the Lincoln Navigator (my wife drives a 2006 model), the Cadillac Escalade, the GMC Yukon Denali, the Chevy Tahoe LTZ, and the Toyota Sequoia Platinum.  I am 6'-8"" and immediately eliminated the Toyota Sequoia as I could not even sit in the driver seat due to the very short headroom as my head hit the ceiling even with the seat back reclined pretty significantly.  I loved the legroom and headroom for all the GM products as they had best in class legroom, but GM still has not engineered a decent 3rd row seat to fold flat into the floor.  While they advertise the new versions that way, in reality you lose at least 4"" in the height of the cargo area as they have artificially raised the cargo floor to accommodate the third row seating when folded down.  Legroom on their 3rd row seating was basically unusable.  That left the Lincoln Navigator and the Ford Expedition, but there was simply no comparison when evaluating the quality of the vehicles between the Infiniti QX80 and the Ford and Lincoln products.  I have been extremely pleased with the outstanding quality of my QX-80.  With 400 horsepower it has plenty of power to provide effective performance for such a large, heavy vehicle.  While it does not have sports car acceleration, if you are driving a full size SUV that is not a primary consideration.  I have found the 5.6 liter engine to have plenty of power and zip and even when cruising at 70 mph there is still plenty of acceleration when you need to pass.  The 315 horses available on my 2006 QX56 was adequate, and the new fuel injection on the QX80 provides a noticeable difference in power.  The greatest improvements in with the QX-80 is in the changes made with technology to improve the ride and to make the driving experience safer.  I have found the blind spot monitor to be a tremendous help, and the intelligent cruise control is an amazing technology to monitor what is happening with vehicles ahead of you to ensure safe distances are maintained.  If you have not used this technology, you will love it as you can set the interval you are looking to maintain and the sensors on the vehicle do an amazing job of monitoring not only the vehicle immediately in front of you, but also the vehicle on ahead to determine if there is a potential safety hazard and will automatically adjust the set speed accordingly.The driving and passenger ride experience is incredibly comfortable.  With the long wheel base, the quality of the seats, and the suspension system provides a luxury car ride for your passengers.  I get so many compliments from those riding with me as to how incredibly comfortable the ride is as well as how impressed they are with the luxury finish.  Infiniti has used very high quality materials and it is very evident in the look and feel of the vehicle.  Even with the size of a full size SUV, the QX80 handles incredibly well for both highway driving, city driving, and the surround view cameras and sensors make it every easy to handle vehicle even in tight spaces.  Turning radius is excellent for this size vehicle and I can actually U-turn in a much smaller radius than many passenger cars.  This vehicle is a dream to drive on the highway as the ride is so comfortable, yet when needed the handling is very responsive.

End 11/16 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Not for everyone & it's not an SUV," First, I realize that this car (not SUV) is not for everyone. I was seeking to get out of my Mazda CX-9 because the fuel economy was not very good and it was just more vehicle then I needed.  The two big dogs were gone and the kids were older so  I decided it was time to simplify my life and do something for me.  I searched high and low for my next ride and was not interested in driving what everyone else was.  The QX30 is different.  It's compact and loaded with style.  The turbo charged 4 cyl has given me a new super powers...passing speed and the ability merge into traffic with zero effort.  The drivers seat is exceptionally comfortable and it is fun to drive.  Here are the CONs... there is no cargo space.  I can get one carry-on suitcase and a couple of grocery bags in there.  If you are taller than 5'9 and weigh more than you should :( this car will not be comfortable.   It really is a two seater and not suitable for a family.  My five year old and his car seat fit comfortably in the back but it won't work for him in a couple years.  The owner's manual has a hard time fitting into the glove box, my iPhone Plus does not fit anywhere including in the center console.  The infotainment system blows!  It's complicated and is confused when you plug in your phone or more than one person has Bluetooth on in the car.  The upside is that I am glad I took the plunge and I don't miss the extra cargo or seating.  I wish the infotainment system was better but it's not that big of a deal to me.  I like the compact styling because it is more effiecent and prevents me from buying anything that I cannot fit in the cargo space.   The lack of seating keeps people that I don't like out of my car.  Some people complain about the visabilty but if you have driven an SUV you are accustomed to poor visabilty.  I actually find it easier to see what's around me than in my old SUV.  Lastly, taking the plunge to a much smaller vehicle was made easier by the fact that it is leased.  It's fun for now but in a couple years I can try something else.

End 5/18 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Loving our QX30 Premium more than our G37x Coupe!," Love the unique look and sexy / sporty styling of the QX30 and that in 2 plus months of ownership we haven't seen another one on the road.  Having a Full Sized Toyota Sequoia and a Mid sized Nissan Murano as daily drivers, we have driven Infiniti Coupes (G35, G37x, Q60x) as our weekend fun car the past 10 plus years. After a considerable search for our 3rd stall garage fun car, we pulled the trigger on a new 2018 QX30 Premium Crossover loaded with every option. We LOVE it and my wife is now driving it daily and her Murano sits in the garage. :-) She's averaging 25 mpg on her daily commute of 50-50 freeway / town. We've seen 30 mpg on two 300 mile weekend road trips. We embrace the size / dimensions as it offers so much more than our Coupes. Getting in / out is much easier and our dog can hop in the back as well. If your expecting to tote the family around or take several co workers to lunch... you'd better buy a larger SUV.  Hands down the ride quality and the AMAZING 2.0 motor / 7 speed dual clutch trans, impressed us enough to buy it.  Super strong 258 ft lbs of torque at just 1250 RPM, and you'll enjoy zippy guilt free starts as just 1/3 throttle puts you a block down the road while other cars are just crossing the intersection. Near triple digit speeds on entrance ramps are possible. Ride quality was better than Lexus nx200t, nissan Rogue SL, Toyota Rav4 Limited, Honda CRV Touring we also test drove. Assisted Parking is amazing and not only parallel parks but also backs into tight parking spots as well. All you do is monitor the brake and the car steers itself! Sound system is superb, memory seats for both driver and passenger etc. are all top notch. As for handling, it delivers sports car like cornering and a much smoother overall ride. We thought we might miss our 330 hp Infiniti coupes but the QX30 is like a sports sedan on steroids with higher seating, 4 doors, lift gate cargo area, and overall unique and sporty appearance.  The adaptive LED headlights are awesome in that they turn with the steering wheel, and auto high beam took all of about 1 minute to appreciate. As with any new car, there is a learning curve with controls and buttons, and even being the Mercedes influence such as seat position knobs on the door panel, the QX30 has been very easy to learn to navigate all the functions / screens. A few small complaints like having to hold the memory seat button instead of just touch it and placing the steering wheel volume on the right side wouldn't stop us from buying it again. We got an amazing low price and scored the 7 yr 100K wrap warranty for about 1/2 the asking price from a Chicago Infiniti dealer.

 on 07/21/16 18:21 PM (PDT),Jorge ,2015 INFINITI Q60 Coupe Coupe Sport 2dr Coupe (3.7L 6cyl 6M),Excellent Car - Great Value," After 105K miles and 7 1/2 years of ownership, it was time to change my beloved BMW 135i (I6 twin turbo 300HP/300torque / 6 manual) and I looked around high and low for a suitable replacement with a manual transmission. This is a review from BMW's owner perspective. My 2015 Q60S came fully loaded, in fact there were no options to add, which was quite funny and pleasant for me. The leather quality is good and craftsmanship is up to my old BMW. The technology in the car is great and Bluetooth and connections works well, the quality of the sound is very good but I miss the DSP capabilities of my old ride (no digital equalizer, etc). On the driving side, the engine feels powerful but in the high rev spectrum, it does not have the quick response of a twin turbo engine but feel agile enough, I have not explored the high end of the tachometer yet, but I am confident I will have a smile, it is still a 2,000 milesâ engine after all. The space in the back is enough for my 2 daughters on short trips and I am very pleased with the value and amenities of the car. Bottom line is, this car has a very reliable/trusted V6 engine, with Variable Valve and Lift technology but without the add ons that will cause constant repairs in a Turbo engine, like fuel pumps, positive crack valve, sensors, lean conditions, etc. It is a very powerful car and the delivery of the power is non-intimidating, has inexpensive components (normal spark plugs, spare tire, oil stick, jack, etc.) that will make you have a smile every time you have to service it. Missing points: The manual transmission feels normal, not really a short throw, crazy agility delivered close to 5K rpm, no 60/40 rear seat.8,000 Update (Feb 2017)Took a 500 miles trip with my 2 daughters and was nice. The engine has loosen up nicely and now I am enjoying a more spirited driving experience. The manual shifter has also become more engaging.Things i like the most: Service experience at the dealer is great and so inexpensive (<50 USD for oil change). I know BMW service is included but let's talk after 48 months. The 3.7 variable valve with lift V6 engine is great and so engaging after 5K rpm, wonderful! The tires will not make it to 30K miles but I am sure it will be less expensive that run flats. Nothing has broken, no ratles and the leather seats look like new. Very happy with the Infiniti experience so far!Details for improvement and why the germans can charge more: the headlights and fog lights have diferent color temperature, cruise control can have up to 5 mph variation, tilt the navigation a few degrees towards the driver, your right elbow does not have a support while shifting, shifter has to be 1 inch smaller.",5.0,"Excellent Car - Great Value After 105K miles and 7 1/2 years of ownership, it was time to change my beloved BMW 135i (I6 twin turbo 300HP/300torque / 6 manual) and I looked around high and low for a suitable replacement with a manual transmission.
